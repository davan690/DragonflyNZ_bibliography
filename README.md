# Bibliography

This project contains Bibtex bibliographies that are used
by Dragonfly Science. The citations
are formatted so the they work with Ministry of Primary Industries
styles, especially Aquatic Environment and Biodiversity Reports.


## Cleaning

On ubuntu, you can run `./clean.sh` to tidy up the bibliography, and
make sure that all the citations are formatted correctly. This 
script depends on the `bibtool` and `bibclean` packages.
