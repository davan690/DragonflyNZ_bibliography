  abstract = "{* Geochemical and stable isotope tags are often used to attribute individual animals in a sample of mixed origins to distinct sources, be it spawning, overwintering or foraging habitats. In order for individuals to be uniquely classified to one source, modelling approaches generally assume that all potential sources have been characterized in terms of their geochemical signature. This assumption is rarely met in applications of geochemistry in environments where species distributions and spawning grounds are poorly known; statistical methods that can accommodate this problem are therefore essential. * We develop nonparametric Bayesian mixture models for geochemical signatures that estimate the most likely number of sources represented in a mixed sample, both in the absence and presence of baseline data. We then use a marginal clustering framework to evaluate the probability that a fish comes from a particular source. * Using both simulations and a previously analysed data set, we illustrate the method and highlight the potential merits and difficulties. These examples reveal how our interpretations of geochemistry data sets can change when potentially un-sampled sources are taken into account.}",

  abstract = "{ABSTRACT: Elemental signatures of the otoliths of fishes are increasingly used in connectivity studies to infer the natal origins of settlers or recruits. We evaluated the utility of this approach by assessing variability in trace element signatures within otoliths of hatchlings of the common triplefin Forsterygion lapillum. We sampled hatchling otoliths from eggs collected in a spatially hierarchical design spanning a range of environmental conditions (open coasts, bays and sounds, offshore islands) around Cook Strait, New Zealand. Our results indicate that trace element signatures vary among clutches within sites, among sites within regions and between the North Island and South Island of New Zealand. Because sites within some regions are similar to sites in other regions, we tested a statistical grouping framework based on simulated annealing, which aimed to maximize the power to make robust inferences at a given spatial scale with respect to classification error rate. We further adapted and evaluated a statistical exclusion test framework as an alternative to assignment tests when not all putative source populations could be sampled. For our study system, we found that this exclusion method performed well for some individual sites with sufficiently unique signatures, but did not perform well for groups of sites at larger scales. Overall, our work has highlighted some of the challenges that may limit the utility of hatchling otoliths when used alone for inference of natal origins of fish, and we have presented a set of statistical procedures that may improve the strength of inferences for some ecological questions.}",
