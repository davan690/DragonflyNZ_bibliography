  abstract	= "Seabirds are attracted to fishing vessels by the discard
		  of waste from fishing. While this waste provides an
		  available food source, seabirds foraging near vessels are
		  at risk of either being caught or struck by the fishing
		  gear. Within New Zealand waters, there were 212 seabirds
		  observed killed by trawlers during the 2006--07 fishing
		  year. Birds feeding on fishing waste behind trawlers may be
		  struck by the trawl warps. The mortality from warp-strike
		  can be reduced by using mitigation devices, such as tori
		  lines, that deter birds from entering the region between
		  the stern and the warps. While tori lines are partially
		  effective, numbers of warp interactions are reduced to
		  close to zero if no offal or discards are discharged.
		  Strategies that reduce the discharge of fishing waste, such
		  as converting it to fish meal and retaining it on board, or
		  holding waste and discharging it while the vessel is not
		  fishing, are expected to greatly reduce mortality. Many
		  vessels hold waste in a container and discard it at
		  intervals, a practice known as batching, in order to reduce
		  interactions with seabirds.
		  
		  In this study it is determined whether increasing the
		  interval between batched discharges of offal reduces the
		  numbers of albatrosses and petrels behind a squid trawl
		  vessel. The experiment was carried out on a trawler fishing
		  for arrow squid (Nototodarus sloanii) in the Stewart-Snares
		  and Auckland Islands regions, between February 5 and March
		  14, 2008. All fishing waste was held in a 4.5 m3 capacity
		  container, and then dumped at prescribed intervals. Batches
		  were discharged at either 30 minute, 2 hour, 4 hour or 8
		  hour intervals. Seabirds were counted in 40m and 10m radius
		  sweep zones extending behind the stern of the vessel.
		  Observations were made at 5 minute intervals before,
		  during, and after discharge events. Separate counts were
		  made of large birds (principally albatross species), small
		  birds (principally petrels) and Cape petrel (Daption
		  capense). Cape petrel moved away from the area during the
		  trip, and these data are not considered. A statistical
		  model is fitted to the count data from the 40m sweep zone,
		  using Bayesian methods.
		  
		  The experiment demonstrates a clear relationship between
		  discharge and the number of birds close to the stern of the
		  vessel. During discharge events, there was an increase in
		  the total numbers of both large birds and small birds.
		  There was also an increase in the proportion of birds on
		  the water, compared to in the air. The response of the
		  birds to the individual discharge events was rapid, and
		  when discharge ceased the numbers of birds on the water
		  fell back to the level associated with sump water faster
		  than could be resolved by the five minute observation
		  interval.
		  
		  In each of the different bird groups there were, on
		  average, fewer birds present during discharge when there
		  was a four or eight hour interval between discharges,
		  compared to when there was a thirty minute interval. During
		  the four and eight hour treatments, the best estimate was
		  that bird numbers were reduced to between 56% and 89% of
		  the number present when there was a 30 minute interval
		  between batches. In all categories, the median number of
		  birds decreased when the interval between batches increased
		  from two to four hours. The same consistent decrease was
		  not seen between the four hour and eight hour batch
		  intervals. While there is a reduction in numbers as the
		  batch interval increases to four hours, there does not
		  appear to be any further benefit achieved by increasing the
		  batch interval from four to eight hours.
		  
		  During the trip, over 94% of the tows were less than 8
		  hours long. The eight hour storage capacity used for the
		  experiment could be used to hold waste until the end of the
		  tow, and discharge it when the vessel is not fishing. There
		  could then be no interaction between the birds and the
		  warps during the discharge. Rather than using the batching
		  to reduce the numbers of birds behind the vessel, it could
		  be used to eliminate discharge of offal during fishing.",

  abstract	= " Little is known about the nature and extent of incidental
		  captures of seabirds and marine mammals in non-commercial
		  fisheries, either in New Zealand or globally. In New
		  Zealand, participation in recreational fishing is high. A
		  recent survey estimated that 16.5\% of the adult population
		  go saltwater fishing during a year, with 2.5\% of the adult
		  population (81~000 people) fishing at least once during a
		  week. Because of the intensity of recreational fishing, a
		  small rate of interactions between individual fishers and
		  birds or mammals may have a population-level impact. This
		  report includes a literature review, a brief summary of
		  relevant information from available data sources (including
		  the Hector's dolphin database, and the bird banding
		  database), and the results of a boat ramp survey that
		  sought to quantify how frequently birds were caught by line
		  fishers.
		  
		  The literature review found three studies that had
		  specifically focused on the catch of protected species in
		  recreational fisheries. All three studies were of set
		  netting, including a study of the catch of shags in nets
		  set in Otago Harbour, a study of the catch of yellow-eyed
		  penguins in set nets in southern New Zealand, and a study
		  of the catch of Hector's dolphin in set nets in Banks
		  Peninsula. During the Otago Harbour study, all seabird
		  captures were recorded in nets set at Portobello over an
		  eight year period. Spotted shags were the most frequently
		  caught species, with the author suggesting that in the
		  worst summer up to 20\% of the local population may have
		  been caught in set nets within the harbour. In the studies
		  of yellow-eyed penguins and Hector's dolphins it was also
		  believed that the set net mortalities were having a
		  population level impact on the species concerned.
		  
		  The literature also contains a range of other examples of
		  seabirds and marine mammals being caught by a variety of
		  recreational fishing methods. As part of the Ornithological
		  Society of New Zealand beach patrol scheme, records are
		  kept of beach cast birds, including those that show
		  evidence of having been killed from fishing. These records
		  encompass a wide range of species, years, and locations,
		  confirming that seabird hookings and entanglements are a
		  common occurrence throughout New Zealand. The Department of
		  Conservation bird banding database contains over 600
		  records of bands that were returned from fishing. There was
		  little information that could be used to determine whether
		  these birds are caught from recreational or commercial
		  fishing, however. Records of sea lions with hooks and
		  traces consistent with recreational fishing were obtained
		  from the Department of Conservation in Otago.
		  
		  A boat ramp survey was carried out in collaboration with
		  Blue Water Marine Research during the summer of 2007--08.
		  During the survey, 763 interviews were conducted (654 on
		  the northeast coast, and 109 in Otago). This survey has
		  provided the first quantitative information on the rates of
		  seabird capture by recreational fishers, as well as
		  information on the nature of the interactions. Across all
		  the survey, 47\% of fishers recalled witnessing a bird
		  being caught at some stage in the past, and there were 21
		  birds caught on the day of the interview. This was
		  equivalent to a capture rate of 0.22 (95\% c.i.: 0.13 to
		  0.34) birds per 100 hours of fishing. Observers on 57
		  charter trips also recorded seabird captures, with a
		  capture rate of 0.36 (95\% c.i.: 0.09 to 0.66) birds per
		  100 fisher hours, similar to the rate found during the boat
		  ramp surveys.
		  
		  In the northeastern region there were an estimated 4.8
		  (95\% c.i.: 4.4 to 5.2) million fisher hours line fishing
		  from trailer boats in 2004--05. Applying the seabird
		  capture rate from the interviews to this effort results in
		  an estimate of 11 500 (95\% c.i.: 6600 to 17 200) bird
		  captures per year. Applying the capture rate to an
		  available estimate of recreational fishing effort in all
		  New Zealand suggests that the number of annual captures in
		  recreational fishing may be 40 000 birds. Although the
		  number of interactions is high, the birds were reported as
		  unharmed in 77\% of the capture incidents that were
		  recalled, and only three people reported incidents where
		  the bird died. Because of the qualitative nature of the
		  survey, the fate of birds that have been hooked or tangled
		  remains unclear.
		  
		  The most frequently reported type of bird caught were
		  petrels, followed by seagulls. Captures of albatrosses,
		  shags, gannets, penguins, and terns were also recalled. The
		  only capture reported from Otago on the day of the boat
		  ramp interview was of an albatross.
		  
		  Management of the impacts of recreational fishing on
		  protected species has been focused on spatial restrictions,
		  with set net bans being implemented to protect Hector's and
		  Maui's dolphins. There are also opportunities for line
		  fishers to mitigate seabird captures, including ensuring
		  that weighted baits leave the surface rapidly, using
		  barbless hooks, and carrying dehooking equipment to help
		  free hooked birds. For fishers to change their behaviour,
		  they must be made aware of the potential impacts of
		  recreational fishing on seabird populations. Aside from
		  Hector's dolphins, there is currently little attention
		  given by New Zealand governmental or non-governmental
		  agencies to reducing the impacts of recreational fishing on
		  protected species. The scale of the potential problem
		  suggests that the recreational catch of seabirds and marine
		  mammals should have an increased focus.",

		  the experiment compared three treatments:
		  
		  1- discharging 'unprocessed' waste (fish offal and whole

		  The response to the experimental treatments was determined
		  using seabird abundance within a 40 m-radius semi-circular

		  Mincing reduced the numbers of large albatrosses (Diomedea

		  An experiment to test the effect of two offal management
		  strategies on the numbers of seabirds attending a fishing
		  trawler was carried out during September - October, 2006.
		  The two treatments were (1) sending all offal and waste to
		  the meal plant, so that discharge was reduced to sump
		  water, and (2) passing all waste through a mincer, with
		  25mm holes in the mincing plate, before discharging it. The
		  two treatments were compared with a control, where all
		  waste was directly discharged.
		  
		  To determine the response to the treatments, bird numbers
		  were counted in a semicircular sweep of 40m radius,
		  centered on the middle of the stern of the vessel and
		  extending behind it. Birds were counted in five species
		  groups (large albatross, small albatross, giant petrel,

		  observer data provide a consistent basis for estimating
		  total captures.
		  
		  In this report, generalized linear models were used to
		  estimate total captures of seabirds by trawl and longline
		  methods from observer data. Captures were estimated for the
		  fishing years 2002--03 to 2006-- 07, by fishing within the
		  New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). For trawl,
		  bottom longline, and surface longline fisheries,

		  shearwater (Puffinus griseus), white-chinned petrel
		  (Procellaria aequinoctialis), other albatross species, and
		  other birds. The models were fitted using Bayesian methods,
		  with the captures represented as samples from a negative
		  binomial distribution.
		  
		  The total number of seabirds that were estimated to have

		  fishing year was 3554 (95% c.i.: 2629 to 5270). There were

		  offshore trawl fisheries, 1199 (95% c.i. 746 to 2155)
		  captures in surface longline fisheries, and 921 (95% c.i.:
		  430 to 2330) captures in the bottom longline fisheries for
		  which estimates were made. Due to low observer coverage,
		  trawl fishing targeting inshore fish species, bottom
		  longline fishing from small vessels (< 34 m), was not
		  included in the modelling. Of the five species groups used
		  for the modelling, the other birds and other albatross

		  Across all offshore trawl fisheries, there was a

		  captures falling by 49% between the 2002--03 and 2006--07

		  Generalized linear models were used to estimate total
		  captures of seabirds by trawl and longline methods from the
		  observer data. Captures were estimated for trawl, bottom
		  longline, and surface longline fisheries, for the 2002--03
		  to 2008--09 fishing years (with some models extending back
		  to 1998--99). The estimates were for fishing within the
		  outer boundary of New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone
		  (EEZ). Statistical models were built of captures of five
		  species groups: white-capped albatross (Thalassarche
		  steadi), sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus), white-chinned
		  petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis), other albatross
		  species, and other birds. The models were fitted using
		  Bayesian methods, with the captures represented as samples
		  from a negative binomial distribution.
		  
		  The total number of seabirds that were estimated to have
		  been caught within New Zealand waters during the 2008--09
		  fishing year was 3224 (95% c.i.: 2520 to 4412). Of the
		  total estimated captures, 27.5% were albatross species,
		  with the remainder being petrels and shearwaters. The
		  estimate of seabird captures includes captures in all
		  surface longline fishing, in all trawl fishing other than
		  fishing targeting inshore species, in large-vessel (over 34
		  m long) bottom longline fisheries, and in small vessel
		  bottom longline fisheries targeting snapper in the northern
		  area (FMA1). Observer coverage in the other trawl and
		  longline fisheries was too low to allow for seabird bycatch
		  estimates to be made.
		  
		  There were 1544 (95% c.i.: 1294 to 1892) estimated seabird
		  captures in offshore trawl fisheries, 591 (95% c.i.: 351 to
		  987) estimated captures in surface longline fisheries, and
		  1088 (95% c.i.: 559 to 2719) estimated captures in the
		  bottom longline fisheries for which estimates were made. Of
		  the five species groups used for the modelling, the other
		  birds and other albatross groups had the highest number of
		  estimated captures during 2008--09 (mean estimates of 1207
		  and 618 captures, respectively). In this year there were
		  also mean estimated captures of 528 sooty shearwaters, 269
		  white-capped albatrosses, and 601 white-chinned petrels.
		  The results from the estimation were broadly comparable
		  with results from other projects that have estimated
		  seabird bycatch in New Zealand fisheries. An exception was
		  with seabird captures in large-vessel bottom longline
		  fisheries: in this fishery observer coverage has been
		  biased to vessels that use integrated weight lines.
		  Estimation methods that do not take this into account tend
		  to underestimate seabird bycatch in this fishery. Improving
		  observer coverage of the vessels that do not use integrated
		  longline would reduce the uncertainty in the estimates of
		  seabird bycatch in bottom longline fisheries.
		  
		  Across all included fisheries, there was a significant
		  decrease in the total number of birds caught between
		  2002--03 and 2008--09, with the total number of captures
		  falling by 47.6% between the 2002--03 and 2008--09 fishing
		  years. This fall was associated with declines in effort in
		  trawl, bottom longline, and surface longline fisheries.
		  Estimated seabird captures increased by 29.3% between
		  2007--08 and 2008--09. This increase occurred for a range
		  of seabird species, in a range of different fisheries,
		  despite an ongoing decline in the effort. The reasons for
		  this increase are unclear.
		  
		  The statistical modelling gives insight into the
		  performance of mitigation measures during routine fishing.
		  In large-vessel bottom longline fisheries, the use of
		  integrated weight line was associated with a reduction in
		  the white-chinned petrel capture rate by 87.2% (95% c.i.:
		  40.6 to 97.6). In 2008--09, only 39% of the effort by large
		  bottom-longline vessels was carried out using integrated
		  weight line. In the squid fishery, the capture rate of
		  white-capped albatross fell to 47.1% (95% c.i.: 20.9 to
		  98.8) of what it was before the introduction of mandatory
		  warp mitigation in January 2006. The statistical models
		  also showed that seabirds are more likely to be caught in
		  surface longline fisheries during nights close to full
		  moon, than on other nights. Specifically, other albatrosses
		  and other birds were each over 3 times more likely to be
		  caught in surface longline fisheries when the illumination
		  of the moon's disk was more than 90%.
		  
		  The estimation was based on observer data, and the
		  resulting estimates may be interpreted as the number of
		  captures that would have been reported if there were
		  observers on every vessel. No allowance was made for
		  under-reporting (caused by observers not being able to
		  monitor all fishing activity during observed trips), or
		  cryptic fatalities (caused by birds being killed by the
		  fishing activity, but without the body being brought on
		  board the vessel). In this report, the population
		  consequences of fishing-related seabird fatalities were not
		  considered.",

		  these data, along with information on fishing effort, are
		  used for estimating total captures. Protected species
		  captures reported by fishers are also summarised. In
		  2008--09, the Ministry of Fisheries observer programme
		  introduced a project to increase observer coverage of
		  inshore fishing, including setnet and trawl fisheries.
		  Captures reported from this project were included, greatly
		  increasing observer coverage for inshore trawl and setnet
		  fisheries.
		  
		  Within this report, captures are divided into the following
		  groups: sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus), white-chinned
		  petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis), white-capped albatross
		  (Thalassarche steadi), other al- batrosses, other birds,
		  New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), New Zealand fur
		  seal (Arctocephalus forsteri), dolphins, whales, and
		  turtles. Captures are also reported by fishery, based on
		  method (trawl, bottom longline, surface longline, and
		  setnet), target species, and vessel size for bottom
		  longline vessels. The report contains time series and maps
		  of the observed and estimated captures.
		  
		  In the 2008--09 fishing year, there were 465, 66, 34, and
		  21 seabirds observed caught in trawl, surface longline,
		  bottom longline, and setnet fisheries, respectively.
		  Observed captures in trawl fisheries, surface longline
		  fisheries, and setnet fisheries increased compared to the
		  2007--08 year, and observed captures in bottom longline
		  fisheries decreased. The most frequently caught seabird
		  species were sooty shearwater, white-chinned petrel, and
		  white-capped albatross, with 132, 90, and 81 observed
		  caught, respectively. In addition to seabirds, 92 New
		  Zealand fur seals, 3 New Zealand sea lions, 20 common
		  dolphins (Delphinus delphis), 2 pilot whales (Globicephalus
		  mela), 2 leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), 1
		  Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori), and 1 green
		  turtle (Chelonia mydas) were observed caught during
		  2008--09.
		  
		  Estimates of captures made using statistical modelling were
		  available for some species groups and fisheries. These
		  estimates were able to account for some non-representivity
		  of observer coverge. Model estimates were avaliable for
		  seabirds in trawl, surface longline, large vessel (over 34
		  m in length) bottom longline fisheries, and snapper bottom
		  longline fisheries in north-eastern New Zealand.
		  Model-based estimates were also available for common
		  dolphin captures in the North Island jack mackerel fishery,
		  fur seal captures in trawl fisheries, and sea lion captures
		  in trawl fisheries. In fisheries, areas, and years where
		  model based estimates had not been made, and where there
		  was sufficient observer coverage, a simpler
		  ratio-estimation method was used to estimate total captures.
		  
		  The estimated captures of seabirds in trawl fisheries
		  increased to 1601 (95% c.i.: 1351 to 1949, based on 43.2%
		  of effort) in 2008--09 from 1111 (95% c.i.: 887 to 1431,
		  based on 44.1% of effort) in 2007--08. During 2008--09, the
		  estimated total seabird captures in surface longline
		  fisheries was 591 (95% c.i.: 351 to 987, based on 100.0% of
		  effort), and the estimated seabird captures in bottom
		  longline fisheries was 1320 (95% c.i.: 778 to 2414, based
		  on 69.6% of effort). In both surface and bottom longline
		  fisheries, estimated captures of seabirds in 2008--09 were
		  similar to the estimated number of captures in 2007--08. In
		  both cases, there were increases in the mean number of
		  estimated captures, but the increases were not significant.
		  
		  The estimated number of New Zealand sea lion interactions
		  in all trawl fisheries for 2007--08 was 74 (95% c.i.: 31 to
		  147, based on 41.0% of effort); the lowest estimated number
		  of interactions since 2002--03. In the Auckland Islands
		  squid fishery, sea lion exclusion devices (SLEDs) are used.
		  These devices prevent sea lions from entering the cod end,
		  and are designed to allow them to escape from the net. The
		  estimated number of interactions is an estimate of the
		  number of sea lions that would have been caught if no SLEDs
		  had been fitted. Model estimated captures of fur seals in
		  trawl fisheries were 550 (95% c.i.: 338 to 826, based on
		  42.8% of effort), the second lowest estimated number of
		  captures in the eleven year period covered by the summary.
		  
		  Data from setnet fisheries were included in the report. In
		  2008--09, there were increased observations of setnet
		  fishing as part of the inshore coverage programme. Observer
		  coverage reached 13%, with 2008--09 being the first year
		  that coverage of setnet fishing exceeded 1%. Observed
		  captures in setnet fisheries in 2008--09 included 8 Cape
		  petrels, 5 sooty shearwaters, 5 yellow-eyed penguins, 1
		  Hector's dolphin, and 1 fur seal. The Hector's dolphin was

		  to test whether mincing of waste and discards reduces the
		  number of birds attending fishing trawlers. The trial was
		  carried out on a Korean trawler, fishing in the southern
		  squid fishery during April and March, 2007. The numbers of
		  birds were counted in 40m and 10m semicircular sweep zones
		  extending behind the vessel. Counts were made of five
		  different species categories (large albatross, small
		  albatross, giant petrel, other petrel and shearwater, and
		  cape pigeon). The birds were also classified into three
		  behavioural categories (flying, sitting on the water, and
		  actively feeding).
		  
		  Three different offal treatments were used (discharge
		  without any processing, mincing all waste with continuous
		  discharge, and mincing all waste with batched discharge).
		  During the trip, the fisheries observer who was
		  implementing the experimental protocol made a total of 85
		  observations. Of these, 35 were made when the factory was
		  not operating and so when there was no discharge. These
		  observations provide a control, but cannot be used for
		  distinguishing between the different treatments. There were
		  some problems with the minced and batched protocols. Early
		  in the voyage there was a high volume of discards which
		  could not be batched, as there was insufficient room in the
		  factory. The batched protocol was then changed to minced.
		  On one tow, when the vessel was targeting hoki, the bycatch
		  clogged the mincer and an unprocessed treatment was
		  substituted. In addition, there were sometimes rocks in the
		  trawl and these could not be put through the mincer. Small
		  numbers of rocks could be removed by hand by the crew, but
		  large numbers meant the minced treatment had to be changed
		  to unprocessed.
		  
		  Despite these problems, the preliminary analysis suggests
		  that there was a treatment effect, with fewer large and
		  small albatross attending the vessel when the discharge was
		  minced. The batched treatment also reduced the total
		  numbers of large and small albatross within the 40m sweep
		  zone. The significance of these results will be checked by
		  statistical modelling.
		  
		  The observer also made 100 strike observations, 50 of trawl
		  warp strikes and 50 of strikes on the tori lines. There
		  were no warp strikes observed during the voyage, and so
		  only the tori line strikes are considered. The effect of
		  treatment on the strikes is unclear. There are fewer large
		  bird strikes when the discharge is minced, but more small
		  bird strikes.",

		  Captures are summarised into the following species groups:
		  white-capped albatross (Thalassarche steadi); white-chinned
		  petrel (Procellaris aequinocalis); sooty shearwater
		  (Puffinus griseus); other albatross; other birds; New

		  In the 2006--07 fishing year there were 212, 187, and 58
		  birds observed caught in trawl, surface longline and bottom
		  longline fisheries, respectively. The birds most frequently
		  caught were sooty shearwater, white-capped albatross, and
		  Buller's albatross (Thalassarche bulleri), with 86, 84, and
		  56 individuals being observed caught, respectively. Other
		  captures included 12 of the critically endangered Chatham
		  albatross (Thalassarche eremita) caught in bottom longline
		  fisheries; 30 wandering-type albatross caught in surface
		  longline fisheries; and 1 black petrel (Procellaria
		  parkinsoni) caught during an inshore trawl.
		  
		  Estimated captures of seabirds in trawl fisheries decreased
		  from 1930 (95% c.i.: 1563 to 2340, based on 27.7% of
		  effort) in 2005--06 to 1272 (95% c.i.: 962 to 1641, based
		  on 42.4% of effort) in 2006--07. This decrease was
		  particularly marked in the squid fishery, which was well
		  observed, where estimated catches reduced from 1251 (95%
		  c.i.: 939 to 1627, based on 81.1% of effort) in 2005--06 to
		  427 (95% c.i.: 364 to 496, based on 72.6% of effort) in
		  2006--2007. In surface longline fisheries there were 715
		  birds estimated to have been caught during 2006--07 (95%
		  c.i.: 565 to 885, based on 99.8% of effort). While this was
		  similar to previous years, there was a large increase in
		  birds caught in the charter surface longline fisheries,
		  from 17 (95% c.i.: 16 to 18, based on 100.0% of effort) in
		  2005--06 to 176 (95% c.i.: 154 to 201, based on 100.0% of
		  effort) in 2006--07. In bottom longline fisheries 1120
		  birds were estimated caught in 2006--07 (95% c.i.: 581 to
		  1796, based on 49.6% of effort). The high uncertainty in

		  mammals, and turtles during trawl and longline fishing
		  within the outer boundary of the New Zealand Exclusive
		  Economic Zone (EEZ) between 1 October 1998 and 30 September
		  2008. Ministry of Fisheries observers record captures of
		  seabirds, marine mammals, and turtles, and these data,
		  along with information on fishing effort, are used for
		  estimating total captures.
		  
		  Within this report, captures are divided into the following
		  groups: sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus), white-chinned
		  petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis), white-capped albatross
		  (Thalassarche steadi), other albatrosses, other birds, New
		  Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), New Zealand fur seal
		  (Arctocephalus forsteri), dolphins, whales, and turtles.
		  Captures are also reported by fishery, based on method
		  (trawl, bottom longline, and surface longline) and target
		  species. The report contains time series and maps of the
		  observed and estimated captures.
		  
		  In the 2007--08 fishing year there were 233, 37, and 40
		  birds observed caught in trawl, surface longline, and
		  bottom longline fisheries, respectively. The most
		  frequently caught bird species were sooty shearwater,
		  white-chinned petrel, and white-capped albatross with 82,
		  74, and 44 observed caught, respectively. Other observed
		  captures included one Westland petrel (Procellaria
		  westlandica) caught in the West Coast South Island trawl
		  fishery; four black petrels, or Parkinson's petrels
		  (Procellaria parkinsoni), caught in scampi trawl and hapuku
		  bottom longline fisheries; and one wandering albatross
		  (Diomedea exulans) caught in the northeast bluenose
		  longline fishery. Another wandering albatross was caught
		  and released alive. All of these species are classified as
		  vulnerable by the IUCN.
		  
		  Estimated captures of seabirds in trawl fisheries decreased
		  by 13.2% from 1023 (95% c.i.: 906 to 1150, based on 40.9%
		  of effort) in 2006--07 to 911 (95% c.i.: 797 to 1 040,
		  based on 40.8% of effort) in 2007-- 08. This decrease is
		  most likely explained by the concurrent 13.9% decrease in
		  effort across all trawl fisheries. The ratio estimate for
		  bird captures in surface longline fisheries for 2007--08
		  was 449 (95% c.i.: 127 to 862, based on 98.2% of effort).
		  The ratio estimate for bird captures in bottom longline
		  fisheries for 2007--08 was 368 (95% c.i.: 224 to 539, based
		  on 61.6% of effort). No snapper target bottom longline
		  fishing was included in this estimate, as no observations
		  were made in this fishery.
		  
		  In addition to seabirds, 11 New Zealand sea lions, 151 New
		  Zealand fur seals, 20 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis),
		  1 bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), 1 whale, and 1
		  leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) were observed
		  caught during 2007--08. The estimated number of New Zealand
		  sea lions captures in all trawl fisheries for 2007--08 was
		  39 (95% c.i.: 27 to 51, based on 41.8% of effort); the
		  lowest estimated catch in nine years. This figure does not
		  include sea lions that may have escaped or been ejected by
		  sea lion exclusion devices used in the Auckland Islands
		  squid trawl fishery. Ratio estimates of fur seal and
		  dolphin captures in all trawl fisheries were the highest
		  for three years.
		  
		  Observer coverage in inshore trawl fisheries remained very
		  low. In 2007--08, only 158 inshore trawls were observed,
		  0.3% of the fishery. In the 2007--08 fishing year, 56.1% of
		  all trawls were in inshore fisheries: estimates of captures
		  were not made on any of this effort. ",

		  observers have been carrying out warp strike observations,
		  recording the numbers of birds that are struck by trawl
		  warps during 15 minute observation periods. In 2004--05,
		  the observations were aimed at exploring the relation
		  between offal discharge and warp strikes. In 2005--06,
		  monitoring of mitigation devices was introduced and the
		  observations include those made as part of an experiment
		  exploring the efficacy of warp-strike mitigation devices.
		  In 2006-- 07, regulations requiring the use of warp
		  mitigation devices were introduced, and the observations
		  are from ongoing monitoring. In this report, a summary is
		  presented of all the strike data collected from 2004--05 to
		  2006--07. The analysis provides an overview of the strike
		  data and an indication of the main trends. During this
		  period a total of 12 097 strike observations were made.
		  Most observations (58.8%) were made in the squid trawl
		  fishery, with some also being carried out in hoki (16.9%)
		  and other trawl fisheries.
		  
		  The average warp strike rate has decreased since 2004--05,
		  when warp strike observations were first made in New
		  Zealand fisheries. For small birds (all birds other than
		  albatrosses and giant petrels), the average warp strike
		  rate has decreased from 3.03 to 0.55 strikes per hour. For
		  large birds (albatrosses and giant petrels), the average
		  warp strike rate has decreased from 2.35 to 0.39 strikes
		  per hour. The decrease is associated with an increase in
		  the use of mitigation devices, which were made mandatory in
		  January 2006 for all trawlers over 28 m in length fishing
		  in New Zealand waters. In 2004--05 mitigation was not
		  compulsory and was used during 48% of the observations. In
		  2006--07, mitigation was used during 92% of observations.
		  The most frequently used mitigation devices in 2006--07
		  were tori lines, which were used during 56% of
		  observations. Statistical modelling confirms that the
		  strike rate of both large and small birds is reduced when
		  tori lines are used as a mitigation device. Other devices
		  such as warp scarers and bird bafflers are not found to
		  significantly reduce the warp strike rate.
		  
		  The warp strike dataset provides strong evidence that the
		  increased use of tori lines has led to a reduction in the
		  number of albatross mortalities. From 2004--05 to 2006--07,
		  there was a decrease in large bird warp capture rate from
		  6.7 to 0.4 birds per 100 tows. Capture rates of small birds
		  on the warps are too low to infer a trend in the rate.
		  Statistical modelling of large bird warp captures shows
		  that they decrease when tori lines are used, and increase
		  when there is continuous discharge. While the warp capture
		  rate of large birds has decreased, there has been no
		  consistent change in the net captures.
		  
		  The analysis also shows the importance of offal management,
		  with few warp strikes or captures being recorded in the
		  absence of offal discharge. Across all the data the average
		  large bird warp strike rate is 0.02 strikes per hour when
		  there is no discharge, compared with 3.22 strikes per hour
		  when discharge is continuous. The large bird warp capture
		  rate when no discharge was recorded during the warp
		  observations was 0.2 birds per 100 tows, compared with an
		  average capture rate of over 7 birds per 100 tows when
		  offal or discards were discharged.
		  
		  For every large bird captured on the warps, there are 208
		  (95% c.i.: 150 to 290) warp strikes, and for every small
		  bird captured on the warps there are 7610 (95% c.i. 3800 to
		  36 000) warp strikes. It is likely that birds are killed by
		  warp strike but not brought on board, and so not counted as
		  captures. Currently, estimates of seabird mortality in New
		  Zealand fisheries are based solely on landed captures and
		  the true mortality from trawl fishing is likely to be
		  underestimated. An estimate of the ratio of warp strikes to
		  warp mortality is needed to allow total mortality to be
		  assessed. ",

		  report, a summary is presented of all the strike data
		  collected from 2004--05 to 2008--09. Warp strike
		  observations largely ceased in 2008--09, with the only
		  observations being made on a trip that began during the
		  2007--08 fishing year. The warp strike dataset contains
		  7266 observations made on the trawl warps until the
		  2008--09 fishing year, Over all years, 67.4% of warp
		  observations were made during squid trawls. The next most
		  frequently sampled fishery was hoki, with 12.1% of warp
		  observations being made during hoki target trawls. In
		  2007--08 and 2008--09, 120 warp strike observations were
		  also made on smaller trawlers targeting inshore species.
		  
		  The use of mitigation devices, which deter seabirds from
		  entering the regions between the stern of a trawler and the
		  trawl warps, was made mandatory in January 2006 for all
		  trawlers over 28 m in length fishing in New Zealand waters.
		  Warp strike rates were highest during the 2004--05 fishing
		  year, before the legislated requirement to use mitigation
		  devices. In that year, in the squid fishery, average strike
		  rates of 1.53 heavy contacts per hour were recorded for
		  small birds (all birds other than albatrosses and giant
		  petrels), with the strike rate of large birds (albatrosses
		  and giant petrels) being 3.41 heavy contacts per hour. By
		  2007--08, the squid fishery warp strike rates for small and
		  large birds had reduced to 0.36 and 0.52 heavy contacts per
		  hour, respectively. There is strong evidence that this
		  reduction was due to an increased use of mitigation
		  devices, particularly tori lines. The results from
		  statistical modelling are that using tori lines reduces the
		  warp strike rate to less than 25% of the strike rate that
		  occurs when no mitigation is used.
		  
		  In 2007--08, the warp strike rates recorded in inshore
		  fisheries were higher than the rates recorded in the squid
		  fishery. Although the number of observations was small,
		  these data confirm that warp strikes do occur on smaller
		  inshore vessels. Moreover, there were 3 large bird and 1
		  small bird warp captures during tows with targeting inshore
		  species that had warp strike observations.
		  
		  The analysis confirmed the importance of offal management,
		  with few warp strikes or captures being recorded in the
		  absence of offal discharge. Across all the data, the
		  average large bird warp strike rate was 0.03 strikes per
		  hour when there is no discharge, compared with 3.30 strikes
		  per hour when there was intermittent or continuous
		  discharge of factory waste. Corresponding to the reduction
		  in warp strikes when there was reduced discharge, there was
		  also a reduction in warp captures when discharge was low.
		  The large bird warp capture rate when no discharge was
		  recorded during the warp observations was 0.2 birds per 100
		  tows, compared with an average capture rate of over 6.7
		  birds per 100 tows when offal or discards were discharged.
		  
		  For every large bird that was reported by the observers as
		  being captured on the warps, there were an estimated 244
		  (95% c.i.: 190 to 330) large bird warp strikes. For every
		  small bird reported by the observers as being captured on
		  the warps, there were an estimated 6440 (95% bootstrap
		  c.i.: 3400 to 20000) small bird warp strikes. It is likely
		  that some birds are killed by warp interactions, but not
		  brought on board the vessels. Currently, estimates of
		  seabird mortality in New Zealand fisheries are based solely
		  on landed captures and the true mortality from trawl
		  fishing is likely to be underestimated. An understanding of
		  the fate of birds that have struck the warps is needed
		  before the true seabird mortality in trawl fisheries can be

  abstract	= "The surf clam toheroa (\emph{Paphies ventricosa}) is
		  endemic to New Zealand, where it inhabits the intertidal
		  zone on exposed sandy beaches in North and South Island
		  regions. Toheroa are of great cultural importance, and have
		  a long history of supporting customary, recreational and
		  commercial fisheries. Owing to substantial population
		  declines, toheroa are currently only targeted in limited
		  customary fisheries.
		  
		  The main toheroa populations in Southland are at Oreti and
		  Bluecliffs beaches, where they have been regularly
		  monitored since the late 1960s, including Ministry for
		  Primary Industries (MPI) surveys. The present report
		  documents the most recent MPI survey in Southland,
		  conducted in \mbox{2013--14} at Oreti, Bluecliffs, and
		  Orepuki beaches. The latter beach supports a small toheroa
		  population that has not been part of the regular surveys
		  before, but was the focus of a population study in 2008.
		  
		  The primary aim of the survey was to estimate the
		  population of toheroa with shell lengths $\geq$40~mm. The
		  total population estimate for the population of these
		  toheroa at the three Southland beaches was 1~489~000 (95\%
		  CI: 1~036~ 000--1~941~000) individuals in \mbox{2013--14}.
		  Oreti Beach continued to support the largest toheroa
		  population in Southland, with an estimated population size
		  of 1~395~000 (95\% CI: 951~000--1~840~000) toheroa
		  $\geq$40~mm shell length at this beach. Of these toheroa,
		  an estimated 1~005~000 (95\% CI: 644~000--1~367~000)
		  individuals were $\ge$100~mm shell length. In addition,
		  there were estimated to be 2~052~000 (95\% CI:
		  755~000--348~000) juvenile toheroa ($<$40~mm shell length)
		  at Oreti Beach. The population of larger toheroa at Oreti
		  Beach appeared to be stable, with a similar estimated
		  number of toheroa at $\ge$100~mm shell length to that in a
		  previous survey in 2009 (980~000, 95\% CI:
		  780~000--1~200~000); although this previous survey covered
		  a smaller area of the beach, excluding the area known as
		  the reserve. In contrast, the mean estimate of the number
		  of juvenile toheroa ($<$40~mm shell length) was around one
		  third the estimate from the 2009 survey (6~030~000, 95\%
		  CI: 3~056~000--9~005~000).
		  
		  A marked change at Oreti Beach was that gravel was noted in
		  many of the quadrats (23.8\% of all quadrats, with no
		  gravel or stones recorded in 2009). The increase in the
		  occurrence of gravel may be associated with the decrease in
		  juvenile toheroa. This notion was supported by statistical
		  modelling of the number of toheroa within each quadrat at
		  Oreti Beach, which indicated a negative association between
		  counts of juvenile toheroa and the presence of gravel. A
		  negative association was also found between juvenile
		  toheroa and ghost shrimp burrow density. There was no
		  association between large toheroa and these habitat
		  characteristics.
		  
		  Toheroa $\geq$40~mm shell length were present at high
		  densities at the southern end of the beach, close to the
		  entrance of New River Estuary, and also about \mbox{11--14}
		  and \mbox{15--16}~km along the beach; they were present at
		  low densities in other areas. Across the beach, individuals
		  in this size class were predominantly in the mid- to
		  low-intertidal zone. Juvenile toheroa also showed the
		  highest concentration in the southern part of Oreti Beach,
		  but their spatial distribution extended across the entire
		  intertidal zone, including the upper intertidal area in
		  this and other parts of the beach. The size-frequency
		  distribution of the Oreti Beach population was bimodal,
		  with a distinct cohort of juveniles and a second cohort of
		  individuals at shell lengths $\ge$80~mm. There were few
		  toheroa at intermediate sizes. The decrease in juvenile
		  toheroa at Oreti Beach may be related to episodic
		  recruitment. Nevertheless, if the number of juveniles
		  remains low, it would in turn lead to lower recruitment to
		  the adult population. In recent years, Bluecliffs Beach has
		  been eroded, and the toheroa population there was small,
		  with a total estimate of 65~000 (95\% CI: 0--150 000)
		  toheroa $\ge$40~mm shell length in two disjunct areas,
		  including the western bay. The number of smaller juvenile
		  toheroa at Bluecliffs Beach was not estimated. Although the
		  sample size was small, the spatial distribution of toheroa
		  at Bluecliffs Beach appeared to extend across most of the
		  intertidal zone, from about 30~m distance from the toe of
		  the dune to the low tide mark. The size frequency
		  distribution was unimodal, with a strong cohort of
		  juveniles and few individuals at intermediate and large
		  sizes.

  abstract	= "Coastal environments throughout New Zealand contain a
		  number of bivalve species that are valued in recreational
		  and customary fisheries. In sheltered, sedimentary
		  habitats, these bivalves include cockles (\emph{Austrovenus
		  stutchburyi}) and pipi (\emph{Paphies australis}), which
		  are both common in a range of embayments, estuaries, and
		  harbours. Throughout northern North Island, cockle and pipi
		  populations are often the main target for recreational and
		  customary fisheries. To monitor the sustainability of these
		  non-commercial fisheries, regular population surveys have
		  been commissioned by Ministry for Primary Industries to
		  assess the cockle and pipi populations in areas targeted by
		  non-commercial fisheries in the wider Auckland region,
		  Northland, Waikato, and Bay of Plenty.
		  
		  This study presents the findings from the most recent
		  cockle and pipi survey in the northern North Island region,
		  conducted in the \mbox{2013--14} fishing year. The sites
		  included in the current survey were Cockle Bay, Grahams
		  Beach, Little Waihi Estuary, Marsden Bank, Okoromai Bay,
		  Pataua Estuary, Tairua Harbour, Umupuia Beach, Waikawau
		  Beach, Waiotahi Estuary, and Whangateau Harbour. In
		  addition to assessing the cockle and pipi populations, the
		  current survey collected sediment data to provide baseline
		  information on possible causative factors for population
		  change (sediment organic content and grain size) across the
		  survey sites.
		  
		  Cockle populations were present at nine sites, and
		  population estimates ranged from 4.41~million individuals
		  at Grahams Beach to 545.24~million cockles at Whangateau
		  Harbour. Cockle population densities varied between the
		  lowest value of 16~cockles per m$^{2}$ at Grahams Beach and
		  the highest estimate of 1317~cockles per m$^{2}$ at Pataua
		  Estuary. A number of populations were characterised by
		  small-sized individuals ($<$30~mm shell length), and most
		  sites had declining trends in the number of large-size
		  cockles over time. Only two sites, Cockle Bay and Umupuia
		  Beach contained high numbers of large individuals in the
		  cockle population, although the total number of cockles at
		  Cockle Bay was markedly lower in the present survey than in
		  the previous assessment in \mbox{2012--13}.
		  
		  Pipi populations were present at seven sites, and estimated
		  population sizes varied from 3.23~million pipi at Marsden
		  Bank to 113.46~million pipi at Little Waihi Estuary. The
		  corresponding population densities ranged from 21~pipi per
		  m$^{2}$ at Marsden Bank to 941~pipi per m$^{2}$ at Waiotahi
		  Estuary. Numbers and densities of large pipi (defined as
		  $\ge$50~mm shell length) were low at five of the seven
		  sites that contained pipi, at $\le$1 individual per
		  m$^{2}$. At the remaining two sites, densities of large
		  pipi were slightly higher, with 5 and 27 pipi per m$^{2}$
		  at Tairua Harbour and Little Waihi Estuary, respectively.
		  
		  Population estimates for pipi at Marsden Bank reflected a
		  continued decline in \mbox{2013--14}, following a marked
		  reduction documented in the previous survey in
		  \mbox{2012--13}. At Waikawau Beach, the pipi population has
		  disappeared since the preceding survey in \mbox{2005--06},
		  coinciding with a change from a sedimentary habitat to a
		  beach characterised by large gravel and pebbles.
		  
		  The present study also provided broad-scale information of
		  sediment properties at the survey sites, including organic
		  content and grain size. Most sites were characterised by
		  low sediment organic content (i.e., $<$5\%) and a small
		  proportion of fines (silt and clay,
		  < 63~$\mu$ m grain size),
		  although the latter was high in some samples, most notably
		  at Cockle Bay and Umupuia Beach (up to 42 and 77\%,
		  respectively). ",

		  often hampered by scarcity of data of the number and
		  identity of captured individuals, risk assessments provide
		  a systematic approach to identifying and evaluating
		  potential impacts of fishing-related mortalities, while
		  also accounting for uncertainty.
		  
		  The present study forms the basis for a risk assessment of
		  the interactions between different commercial fisheries and
		  marine mammals in New Zealand waters. Considering the 35
		  marine mammal (sub)species that inhabit New Zealand waters,
		  population data relevant to the risk assessment process
		  were summarised for each of the 10 mysticetes, 22
		  odontocetes (including dolphins and beaked whales), and
		  three pinnipeds. Existing bycatch data were used to
		  characterise the different types of interactions between
		  these marine mammals and trawl, longline, setnet, and
		  pot/trap fisheries.
		  
		  There were few bycatch records of baleen whales in New
		  Zealand, with observed entanglements involving Bryde's,
		  humpback and southern right whales. Data from other regions
		  show that the majority of recorded bycatch incidents were
		  entanglements and injuries in static gear, predominantly
		  involving species and populations that reside in coastal
		  waters. Although the New Zealand Bryde's whale population
		  is resident in coastal northern North Island waters, the
		  main threat identified for this species was not
		  fisheries-related, but vessel collision, particularly in
		  Hauraki Gulf.
		  
		  For toothed cetaceans, bycatch documentation showed that
		  direct interactions with fishing operations often lead to
		  immediate mortality, particularly for small-sized dolphins,
		  as captured individuals are unable to free themselves and
		  drown in fishing gear. Furthermore, the coastal
		  distributions of many dolphin species and their attraction
		  to fishing vessels expose them to the risk of fisheries
		  bycatch. Consistent with data from elsewhere, almost all
		  toothed cetacean species have featured in bycatch reports
		  in New Zealand, involving trawl, longline and gill/set-net
		  fisheries. In addition to bycatch in trawl and gill/set-net
		  fisheries, there have been documented Hector's dolphin
		  entanglements in lobster fishing gear. Lobster pot gear has
		  also been implicated in the bycatch of bottlenose dolphin
		  and long-finned pilot whale in other regions.
		  
		  For pinnipeds, trawl fisheries were the most significant
		  source of mortality, with high numbers of New Zealand fur
		  seal and New Zealand sea lion incidentally captured in
		  these fisheries in New Zealand waters. New Zealand fur seal
		  were also frequently bycaught in surface-longline fisheries.
		  
		  Data reviewed here led to the identification of different
		  fisheries-marine mammal interactions, and will inform the
		  next step in the risk assessment process involving marine
		  mammals and commercial fisheries in New Zealand. ",

		  studies have dealt with the underlying behavioural
		  mechanisms and their ecological implications. Breeding
		  populations of seabirds are naturally subdivided at
		  different spatial scales and represent good models to study
		  these processes. In particular, detailed observations on a
		  kittiwake Rissa tridactyla population in Brittany, France,
		  suggested that individuals use the reproductive success of
		  conspecifics for selecting among potential breeding
		  patches. In particular, failed breeders and young
		  prospecting birds were suspected to be attracted successful
		  areas. The observational data used nevertheless did not
		  permit to ascertain the causal nature of the associations
		  observed. The aim of the present work was to test
		  experimentally several predictions of this hypothesis.
		  Specifically, we manipulated the local reproductive success
		  of kittiwakes on a set of study plots in order to test the
		  behavioural responses of the birds in terms of attendance
		  of local breeders and prospecting individuals. The
		  experiment was carried out on the island of Horn&#248;ya,

		  increasing brood size during incubation on a series of

		  following their breeding failure and lower prospecting by
		  birds that did not breed on the plot was predicted for
		  plots with reduced local reproductive success. Conversely,
		  we predicted higher attendance of failed breeders and
		  prospectors on plots where a high success was maintained.
		  We also predicted that a higher proportion of failed
		  breeders from unsuccessful plots would be recorded
		  prospecting for sites compared to failed breeders from
		  successful plots. Finally, behavioural responses were
		  expected to be stronger on isolated cliffs compared to
		  plots adjacent to productive areas. Our results are
		  discussed in relation to factors determining heterogeneity
		  among individuals, nest site availability and patch quality
		  at different scales. Understanding the behavioural

		  single strategy will come to dominate the population. In a
		  symbiotic association each species may have a different
		  strategy, and the theoretical analysis of the single
		  species problem is no guide to the outcome. We present
		  basic analysis of two-species cooperation and show that a
		  species with a fast adaptation rate is enslaved by a slowly
		  evolving one. Paradoxically, the rapidly evolving species
		  becomes highly cooperative, whereas the slowly evolving one
		  gives little in return. This helps understand the
		  occurrence of endosymbioses where the host benefits, but
		  the symbionts appear to gain little from the association.",

		  75% of added phosphate from the patch centre by day 3.
		  Non-conservative phosphate loss was largely due to

		  0.3--1.5 nmol/m2/d. The iron/tracer patch partially
		  advected around an anticyclonic Haida Eddy that originated

  abstract	= "Recent research has shown that collisions with trawl warps
		  are a source of seabird mortality in trawl fisheries. To
		  minimise this mortality, a number of devices have been
		  developed to prevent seabirds from being struck by the
		  trawl warps, or from congregating at the stern of the
		  vessels. Designs currently used in New Zealand include twin
		  tori lines, bird bafflers and warp scarers. Legislation now
		  requires that at least one of these devices is used by
		  trawlers fishing within New Zealand waters.
		  
		  Experimental trials of warp strike mitigation devices were
		  carried out in the 2006 southern squid trawl fishery,
		  involving 18 observed vessels. The trials were developed
		  co-operatively by a group that included representatives
		  from the fishing industry, the Ministry of Fisheries, the
		  Department of Conservation and WWF-NZ. Tori lines, bird
		  bafflers (the 4 boom variety) and warp scarers were
		  compared using standardised seabird strike measurements:
		  the number of birds that struck either the warps or the
		  mitigation device during a 15 minute observation period. On
		  the participating trips, different warp strike mitigation
		  treatments were used on different tows according to a
		  randomised experimental design. Key results from the trial
		  are:
		  
		  - Tori lines were most effective at reducing seabird
		  strikes on trawl warps. They reduced the warp strikes to
		  between 5% and 20% of their frequency without mitigation.
		  
		  - Both bird bafflers and warp scarers produced a
		  significant reduction in the number of large bird strikes
		  on the warps, to 35 -- 90% of the level in the absence of
		  mitigation.
		  
		  - Bird bafflers and warp scares also reduced small bird
		  strike rates on the warps, but this reduction was either
		  not statistically significant (for bafflers) or only
		  marginally significant (for warp scarers).
		  
		  - Although there is limited data, the analysis suggests
		  that the bird bafflers are more effective on vessels where
		  the trawl block is closer to the waterline.
		  
		  - Strikes on the mitigation devices themselves were
		  generally less than 20% of the no mitigation strike rates
		  on the trawl warps. The clear exception was the tori lines,
		  which had a strike rate similar to that recorded on the
		  trawl warps without mitigation.
		  
		  - There is no information on whether seabird strikes on
		  tori lines are as dangerous as those on trawl warps.
		  Observer opinion on this was divided. Recorded comments
		  indicate that at least some seabird interactions with tori
		  lines are dangerous for seabirds. However, no dead or
		  injured birds were retrieved from the tori lines, or any of
		  the mitigation devices, during the experiment.
		  
		  - The trials again highlighted the discharge of offal as
		  the main factor influencing seabird strikes. Almost no
		  strikes were recorded when there was no discharge, and
		  strike rates were low when only sump water was discharged.
		  
		  - There was considerable between vessel variability in
		  strike rate. When no mitigation was being used, the vessels
		  that had bafflers on board had a higher strike rate than
		  other vessels in the trial.
		  
		  - Five of the seven bafflers in the trial did not comply
		  with the required specification as the dropper lines did
		  not reach to with 0.5 m of the water surface. Some bafflers
		  had dropper lines that were prone to tangling.
		  
		  - The weights used on warp scarers typically did not allow
		  them to be deployed sufficiently down the warp without
		  entanglement. This often left the few meters of the warp
		  closest to the water unprotected. The clips were not
		  sufficiently robust, and did not pass splices etc. Some
		  vessels had trouble deploying the warp scarers safely. The
		  devices should prove more effective if these technical
		  problems are solved.
		  
		  - Warp scarers and tori lines must be well maintained to
		  meet the required specification (i.e. replacing
		  lost/damaged/dirty streamers etc.)",

  note		= "95~p",
  abstract	= "The fishery for kina in New Zealand is based on a single
		  endemic urchin species (Evechinus chloroticus). This report
		  characterises commercial and customary fisheries for kina,
		  primarily by summarising data from the Ministry of
		  Fisheries catch effort database, and by analysing
		  fine-scale data from a voluntary programme that has
		  operated in the southern kina fishery since 2004--05. The
		  analysis is supplemented by a review of literature on sea
		  urchins and invertebrate fisheries, and by information from
		  semi-structured interviews with commercial and customary
		  stakeholders participating in the New Zealand kina fishery.
		  Kina were introduced into the Quota Management System (QMS)
		  in October 2002 (South Island), and October 2003 (North
		  Island). There are 12 quota management areas (QMAs) for
		  kina, with the commercial kina catch concentrated in four
		  of those: SUR1B (Auckland - South), SUR4 (Chatham Islands),
		  SUR7A (Marlborough Sounds), and SUR5 (Southland). Kina are
		  commercially harvested primarily by hand-gathering while
		  free-diving, but there have also been small dredge
		  fisheries targeting kina in SUR7A and SUR1B.
		  
		  In this report, the kina catch and effort data for dive and
		  dredge fisheries are summarised for the 20 fishing years
		  1989-90 to 2008-09. The kina fishery in New Zealand
		  currently harvests around 750 t of kina per year, compared
		  with a Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) of 1147 t. A
		  small amount of kina bycatch (an average of less than 5 t
		  per year) is reported from fisheries targeting other
		  species. The kina industry is small, with 75% of the catch
		  in the 2008--09 fishing year being harvested by nine
		  vessels. Since the introduction of kina into the QMS, the
		  number of vessels fishing for kina has decreased, and the
		  average catch per vessel per year has increased.
		  
		  In SUR5, a voluntary logbook scheme to collect fine-scale
		  data has been operating since the 2004--05 fishing year. As
		  part of this scheme, one fishing company has recorded their
		  catch in Paua Statistical Areas, using the same format as
		  the Paua Catch Effort Landing Return (PCELR) forms. Kina
		  harvest recorded in fine-scale Paua Statistical Areas
		  accounted for 68% of all kina harvested in SUR5 over that
		  period, with the harvest from SUR5 accounting for 46.6% of
		  the national harvest between 2004--05 and 2008--09. The
		  average catch per unit effort from the fine-scale data was
		  196 kg kina per hour underwater. The best estimate from
		  statistical modelling of the fine-scale data was that in
		  2008--09 the CPUE in the most heavily fished area (F41) was
		  77% of what it had been in 2005--06. There was a 95.3%
		  probability that the CPUE in this area had decreased
		  between 2006 and 2009. The identity of the diver was the
		  most important factor for explaining variation in the CPUE,
		  followed by the diving conditions. One-quarter of the catch
		  reported by the fine-scale scheme came from a single
		  fine-scale area (F41), and two individual divers caught 47%
		  of the catch.
		  
		  Data on the customary harvests of kina were obtained from
		  the Ministry of Fisheries Customary database. These data
		  are reported quarterly, at the QMA level. Some customary
		  fishing occurs under regulation 27 of the Fisheries
		  (Amateur Fishing) Regulations 1986 and reporting is not
		  mandatory. Information from interviews with customary
		  fishers and Tangata Kaitiaki indicated that a large amount
		  of customary fishing may occur under the amateur fishing
		  regulations and is therefore not reported. The customary
		  data held by the Ministry of Fisheries do not represent
		  actual levels of customary harvest.
		  
		  Interviews were conducted with a range of participants in
		  the kina fishery, including commercial fishers, customary
		  fishers, and processors. The interviews were qualitative,
		  and gathered a range of information on practices both
		  within the commercial industry, and by customary fishers.
		  The commercial participants interviewed aided our
		  interpretation of commercial data. Customary fishers or
		  Kaitiaki interviewed stressed available data under-reported
		  customary landings.
		  
		  Recreational harvest of kina have not been well quantified
		  but a diary survey in 2000 suggests that for SUR1, 2, 8,
		  and 9, this could comprise a large portion of the total
		  harvest.
		  
		  As well as a wide range of research conducted on kina
		  ecology and biology, there has been research on the factors
		  that influence roe colour and taste. Few studies of kina
		  distribution and abundance were found that would be
		  relevant to managing the fishery. The literature on
		  managing small scale fisheries targeting sedentary,
		  spatially variable species was explored. A general
		  conclusion was that these fisheries require the use of
		  fisher reported information, and that they require
		  small-scale information on effort and harvest. This report
		  concludes that the commercial kina fishery should be
		  monitored at a smaller spatial scale than currently occurs.
		  This would allow more reliable monitoring of changes in
		  CPUE than is possible with data collected at the
		  statistical area level. More detailed reporting following,
		  for example, the format of the Paua Catch Effort Landing
		  Return (PCELR), would also allow catch and effort to be
		  recorded at the individual diver level. This is important
		  for interpreting any patterns in CPUE. At present kina
		  recovery rate or size are not recorded. Shed sampling for

		  consideration of fishing effects on ecosystems including
		  non-target species. Extensive distributional overlap
		  between fisheries and seabirds, and the attractiveness of
		  the catch and fishery waste to foraging birds, leads to
		  fatal interactions between seabirds and fishing gear. In a
		  series of experiments, we have investigated measures for
		  managing trawl processing waste to reduce seabird
		  mortalities. Different fisheries generate different volumes
		  of processing waste, and vessel capacities for holding this
		  waste can vary significantly both within and between trawl
		  fleets. Here, we compare seabird responses to discharging
		  trawl fisheries waste ad hoc, as and when waste became
		  available, with responses to discharging waste after
		  holding periods of 30 min and 2 h. Using abundance as a
		  proxy for the risk of mortality, we show that compared to
		  discharging ad hoc, holding waste for two specified periods
		  prior to discharge significantly reduces vessel attendance
		  by small seabirds, and both small and large seabirds,
		  respectively. Drawing on this study and our past work, we
		  provide best practice guidelines for trawler waste
		  management to reduce seabird mortality due to interactions
		  with trawl warps. If the ideal approach of discharging
		  waste only when fishing gear is out of the water is
		  impossible, then discharging waste rapidly in maximally
		  large batches, as infrequently as possible is recommended.
		  Holding periods of 30 min to 8 h may be required to reduce
		  the abundance of small species of seabirds attending
		  vessels. For large seabirds, holding periods of 2--4 h are
		  required, and 8 h holding periods are still more effective.
		  Discharging waste as it becomes available is not
		  recommended. Mincing processing waste can reduce the
		  attendance of some seabird species at vessels, especially
		  large albatrosses. However, holding waste is preferred, due
		  to relative simplicity in the mechanics of dealing with
		  waste, lower cost, and greater reductions in seabird
		  abundance. Though developed on trawl fisheries, principles
		  of these guidelines are applicable to any fishery
		  discharging waste attractive to seabirds. While holding
		  fisheries waste can minimise seabird captures on trawl
		  warps worldwide, evidence-based management measures are

		  discharges of trawl catch processing waste and (2) whether
		  decreasing numbers of seabirds attended trawlers during
		  processing waste discharge events as the time interval
		  between these events increased.
		  
		  Waste was retained onboard the vessel for four different

		  Seabird responses reflected the type of discharge released:

  abstract	= {The Potential Biological Removal (PBR) approach was
		  developed in response to the United States Marine Mammal
		  Protection Act, to identify populations experiencing
		  human-caused mortality at levels that could result in
		  population depletion. The PBR is calculated from the
		  maximum population growth rate (rmax) and a lower estimate
		  of the population size (Nmin), as PBR = rmax Nmin f, where
		  f (typically between 0.1 and 0.5) is a "recovery factor"
		  that may be set lower to allow a population to recover
		  faster, or to provide additional protection to the
		  population. If the human-caused mortalities are less than
		  the PBR, then a depleted population will be able to recover
		  so that, given sufficient time, it has a 95% probability of
		  being over half the carrying capacity.
		  
		  When assessing the potential impact of human-caused
		  mortalities on seabird populations, the PBR has been used
		  as a guide to the productivity of the seabird populations.
		  Applying the PBR to seabirds is difficult as neither the
		  maximum growth rate nor the total population size can be
		  directly measured. Instead, approximations must be used
		  that allow estimation of these parameters from readily
		  available data.
		  
		  In this report, we used simulations of seabird demography
		  to assess the accuracy of these approximations. This
		  approach involved three main steps. First, we simulated the
		  population dynamics for 12 types of seabirds, representing
		  a range of species breeding in New Zealand. For each
		  species type, we estimated the maximum human-caused
		  mortality rate that the populations could incur, while
		  still being able to recover to above half the carrying
		  capacity, with 95% probability, in the presence of both
		  environmental and demographic stochasticity. Second, we
		  generated a PBR estimate using an approximate maximum
		  growth rate and population size. The PBR estimate included
		  a parameter rho, calibrated so that the base PBR (PBRb;
		  evaluated with f = 1 and with the total population, N,
		  rather than the conservative estimate, Nmin) had only a
		  5%-probability of exceeding the maximum human-caused
		  mortality. Finally, we explored the effect of errors or
		  bias in the demographic parameters used for the calculation
		  of the PBR, to provide guidance in setting the value of the
		  recovery factor, f.
		  
		  The analysis showed that the approximate base PBR derived
		  from demographic parameter estimates tended to overestimate
		  the maximum human-caused mortality. Inclusion of a
		  calibration factor, rho, was required to adjust the PBR
		  approximations to meet the management criterion; rho varied
		  between 0.17 and 0.61, depending on the species types. In
		  general, the calibration factor was smaller for species
		  with slower growth rates, such as albatrosses, and higher
		  for species with higher growth rates, such as shags and
		  penguins. Previous estimates of the PBR for seabird
		  populations that did not include this calibration factor
		  are likely to have overestimated the human-caused
		  mortalities that the populations could incur. The choice of
		  f values will depend on what errors in the underlying
		  parameters are considered plausible, and on requirements
		  for the recovery time of depleted populations. In this
		  report, some exploration of the consequences of incorrect
		  estimates of the parameters is given, but an explicit
		  recommendation for the choice of f values is not made.
		  
		  With the inclusion of the additional calibration factor,
		  rho, the method for calculating the PBR described here
		  provides a simple way for determining whether
		  fishing-related mortalities are sufficiently low that
		  seabird populations are able to recover to and/or remain at
		  above half the carrying capacity in the long term.}

  abstract	= "We examined the risk of incidental mortality from
		  commercial fishing for 64 seabird species in New Zealand
		  trawl and longline fisheries. For each species, the risk
		  was assessed by comparing the total number of birds
		  potentially killed while fishing against the Potential
		  Biological Removal (PBR) index. This index represents the
		  amount of human-induced mortality a species can sustain
		  without compromising its persistence. The PBR was
		  calculated from the best available information on the
		  species' demography.
		  
		  Because estimates of seabirds' demographic parameters and
		  of fisheries related mortality are imprecise, the
		  uncertainty around the demographic and mortality estimates
		  was explicitly considered. This allowed uncertainty in the
		  resulting risk to be calculated, and also allowed the
		  identification of parameters where improved precision would
		  reduce overly large uncertainties. However, not all sources
		  of uncertainty could be included, and the results are best
		  used as a guide in the setting of research and management
		  priorities. In general, both seabird demographic
		  information and the distribution of seabirds within New
		  Zealand waters were poorly known.
		  
		  Amongst the 64 studied species, the black petrel
		  (\emph{Procellaria parkinsoni}) clearly stood out as the
		  species the most at risk from commercial fishing activities
		  within the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone. With an
		  average number of potential annual fishing-related
		  fatalities estimated to be almost 10 times higher than the
		  PBR, our study suggests that this species should become the
		  primary subject of more detailed research and management.
		  
		  Seven other species had a number of annual potential
		  fatalities significantly exceeding the PBR, as the 95\%
		  confidence interval of their risk ratio was strictly above
		  one: the grey-headed albatross, the Chatham albatross, the
		  Westland petrel, the light-mantled albatross, the Salvin's
		  albatross, the flesh-footed shearwater, and the Stewart
		  Island shag. For a further 12 species, the confidence
		  interval of the risk ratio included one.
		  
		  Small inshore fisheries, especially trawl fisheries
		  targeting flatfish, and small bottom and surface fisheries,
		  appeared to be associated with the greatest level of risk
		  to species. This was due to a combination of low observer
		  coverage, high effort, and overlap with the distributions
		  of many seabird species in these fisheries. In fisheries
		  where there were few observations, the number of potential
		  fatalities was estimated in a precautionary way, with the
		  estimates being biased toward the high end of the range of
		  values that were consistent with the observer data. In
		  these poorly observed fisheries, the risk is primarily
		  associated with the lack of information. Of the species
		  that had a risk ratio greater than one, the risk for four
		  of them (grey-headed albatross, Westland petrel, Chatham
		  albatross, and light-mantled albatross) was associated with
		  a lack of observer coverage in inshore fisheries that
		  overlap with the distribution of these birds. Increasing
		  the number of observations in inshore trawl and small
		  vessel longline fisheries, especially in FMAs 1, 2, 3, and
		  7, would increase the precision of the estimated
		  fatalities. The risk was estimated independently for each
		  fishery, and there was no assumption that the vulnerability
		  of seabirds to capture was related between different
		  fisheries. This has the consequence that birds (such as
		  light-mantled sooty albatross) may be caught infrequently
		  in well observed fisheries, but still have high risk
		  associated with poorly observed fisheries.
		  
		  Many limitations were identified in the risk assessment.
		  These may result in biased estimates (either too high or
		  too low) of the risk of fishing to some seabirds. Moreover,
		  some fisheries were not included in our analysis, and other
		  sources of human-induced mortality were ignored. The
		  conclusions of our results should therefore be interpreted
		  with caution, as some species might be at risk, even if
		  their risk ratio was estimated to be lower than one.
		  Conversely, the fisheries-related fatalities may be
		  overestimated in poorly observed fisheries. The risk
		  assessment method assumed a high number of captures in the
		  absence of observations to the contrary, so the estimated
		  potential fatalities in poorly-observed fisheries may be
		  higher than the actual fatalities. ",

  abstract	= "1. Landscape connectivity, the ability of species to move
		  between different elements of a landscape, has been
		  evaluated mainly by expert opinion, proxy data or homing
		  experiments, all of which have major limitations. Cost
		  distance modelling can overcome these limitations, but the
		  resistance values of different landscape elements are
		  difficult to estimate. 2. Here, we present a novel method
		  combining step selection functions with cost distance
		  modelling to assess functional landscape connectivity.
		  Instead of relying on movement metrics, the method uses a
		  case-control design to assess whether the chosen steps
		  differ from a random sample of alternatives of similar
		  lengths. Alternative models of landscape connectivity and
		  dispersal behaviour are represented as maps of resistance
		  values, and compared using an information-theoretic
		  approach to select those hypotheses that maximize the
		  discrepancy between chosen steps and random alternatives.
		  3. We applied this method to daily locations recorded along
		  the dispersal paths of 38 juvenile North Island robins
		  Petroica longipes in a fragmented pastoral landscape in New
		  Zealand. We compared models with different resistance
		  values for four recognized vegetation types in the
		  landscape and assessed gap-crossing behaviour by changing
		  the resistance value of pasture as a function of distance
		  to the closest woody vegetation. 4. Model comparison showed
		  that juvenile robins move in decreasing order of preference
		  through native forest, plantations and shrubland, and
		  showed a marked reluctance for flying over pasture. Under
		  the best model, the largest gap crossed was 110 m. 5.
		  Synthesis and applications. In combination with data on the
		  total cost distances travelled by dispersers, cost distance
		  models of landscape connectivity can be used to predict
		  distributions of dispersal distances in any landscape with
		  similar vegetation types. They can therefore predict
		  responses of species to landscape management or predict
		  spatial dynamics of populations following reintroduction.
		  Our method is potentially applicable to any dispersal data,
		  even with a relatively small number of locations recorded
		  in complex landscapes, meaning models can be fitted to data
		  that cannot be analysed using previous method. Tools are

  abstract	= "In a recent risk assessment, northern royal albatross was
		  identified as one the seabird species most at risk from
		  incidental captures in commercial fisheries in New Zealand.
		  The uncertainty of the estimated risk was large, owing to
		  its sensitivity to the uncertainty surrounding existing
		  estimates of the annual survival rate. This highlights the
		  need for accurate demographic measures of this species.
		  Demographic rates, such as the annual survival rate, are
		  generally difficult to estimate for long-lived seabirds
		  such as northern royal albatross, because of the length of
		  the study required and the remoteness of colonies. Data
		  from a small population of northern royal albatross
		  (Diomedea sanfordi) that self-established on the mainland
		  of New Zealand at Taiaroa Head, provided a unique data set
		  for the estimation of demographic rates. Banding as well as
		  monitoring of individuals has been carried out at the
		  Taiaroa Head colony since 1938. Data on the
		  presence/absence of birds, as well as on breeding outcomes,
		  were available for the period between 1989--90 and
		  2011--12, and included 2128 annual resightings of 355
		  banded individuals of known-age.
		  
		  The main goal of the present study was to estimate the
		  annual survival rate of juveniles, pre-breeders, and adults
		  at Taiaroa Head. These rates were estimated simultaneously
		  in a single Bayesian multi-state capture-recapture model.
		  Several models were fitted to the data, with different
		  levels of complexity. From the most parsimonious model, the
		  overall annual adult survival rate was estimated as 0.95
		  (95\% c.i.: 0.941--0.959). In this model, adult survival
		  declined with age, from 0.976 (95\% c.i.: 0.963--0.988) at
		  6 years, the minimum age at first breeding, to 0.915 (95\%
		  c.i.: 0.879--0.946) at 40 years. Mean annual survival of
		  pre-breeders was 0.966 (95\% c.i.: 0.95--0.98), and 0.933
		  (95\% c.i.: 0.908--0.966) for juveniles. There was no
		  discernible difference in survival between males and
		  females, and there was no apparent trend in survival over
		  time.
		  
		  Estimates of other demographic rates were also obtained
		  during the estimation process. The mean age at first return
		  of juveniles to the colony was estimated as 4.81 years
		  (95\% c.i.: 4.63--5.06), and the mean age at first breeding
		  as 8.85 years (95\% c.i.: 8.53--9.29).
		  
		  The number of northern royal albatross present annually at
		  the Taiaroa Head colony has doubled since 1989--90, and the
		  current total population size was estimated to be over 200
		  individuals. The ratio of the total population size to the
		  number of annual breeding pairs varied between 5 and 12
		  among years, with an overall mean of 7.65 (95\% c.i.:
		  7.56--7.78).
		  
		  While long-term data allowed estimates of demographic rates
		  of northern royal albatross at Taiaroa Head, the location
		  of the colony and the ongoing management by staff mean that
		  the population dynamics may differ from those of the main
		  population on the Chatham Islands."

		  contributing to declines and extinctions of species.
		  However, the biological factors underlying the effects of
		  fragmentation are still often poorly understood, possibly
		  due to the diversity of scales and approaches taken by
		  researchers. I propose in this thesis an integrative
		  approach that can be applied to any taxa and landscape,
		  using a metapopulation of North Island robins (Petroica
		  longipes) inhabiting forest patches of a fragmented
		  agricultural landscape of New Zealand. In particular, I
		  attempt to integrate the effects of habitat fragmentation
		  on both habitat quality and the dispersal-driven broad
		  scale dynamics of populations. I first analysed the
		  distribution of robins based on presence-absence data,
		  relating presence-absence to local habitat factors as well
		  as size and isolation of forest patches (Chapter 2). Their
		  distribution was found to be primarily limited by the
		  isolation of forest patches, but was also related to some
		  habitat factors. However, habitat fragmentation was not
		  found to affect habitat quality, as the factors found to
		  affect survival and productivity were unrelated to size and
		  isolation, independent from the size or isolation of forest
		  patches (Chapter 3). Based on the radio-tracking of
		  juvenile robins, I applied a choice analysis technique to
		  show that robins need woody vegetation for their natal
		  dispersal and that they are unlikely to cross stretches of
		  pasture greater than 150 m (Chapter 4). Juveniles dispersed
		  a median Euclidean distance of 1 129 m with a maximum of 11
		  km, whereas I predicted from the data that they would have
		  dispersed a median distance of 3 km in continuous forest
		  with a maximum of 20 km (Chapter 5). The consequences of
		  this dispersal limitation and of variations in habitat
		  quality were assessed using a spatially-explicit
		  individual-based metapopulation model that incorporated
		  realistic gap-limited dispersal behaviour of juvenile
		  robins (Chapter 6). Whereas the movement of individuals
		  between patches is commonly assumed to improve the
		  persistence of populations, I found that a weaker
		  gap-crossing ability, and therefore reduced landscape
		  connectivity, increased the metapopulation size at
		  equilibrium. This study highlights the complex effects of
		  habitat loss and fragmentation on the distribution of
		  species, but also the limits of excessive model
		  simplification.",

  abstract	= "The discard of processing waste by fishing trawlers
		  attracts seabirds, putting them at risk from being caught
		  in nets or being struck by fishing gear. In order to
		  minimise the impact of fishing on seabird populations,
		  techniques are required for managing processing waste so
		  that fewer birds are attracted to the stern of trawlers.
		  
		  A simple method, that may reduce the number of birds
		  attracted to trawlers, is to discharge the waste in
		  batches: holding the waste and dumping it periodically,
		  rather than discharging it continuously. In a previous
		  experiment, waste was held for a range of intervals
		  (between 30 minutes and 8 hours), and the influence of
		  discharge interval on seabird abundance was determined. It
		  was found that there were fewer birds behind the vessel
		  when the interval between batches was either 4 or 8 hours
		  long, rather than when it was either 30 minutes or 2 hours.
		  In February and March 2010, a similar experiment was
		  carried out on a trawler that was mainly targeting hoki.
		  The key difference was that this experiment compared the
		  number of birds behind the vessel during continuous
		  discharge with the number that were present with either a
		  30-minute or 2-hour interval between waste discharges.
		  
		  During the experiment, fishing was carried out normally,
		  with the waste discharge being controlled as part of the
		  experiment. For each day of the experiment a particular
		  discharge regime was followed (either continuous,
		  30-minute, or 2-hour). A fisheries observer recorded the
		  abundance of seabirds (large seabirds, Cape petrels, and
		  other small seabirds) within 40 m from the stern of the
		  vessel, making series of up to 12 observations spaced 5
		  minutes apart. During batched treatments, the observations
		  began 5 to 10 minutes before a discharge event.
		  
		  In this report, a preliminary analysis of data from the
		  experiment is presented. Although the level of statistical
		  significance was not tested, the seabird abundance at the
		  back of the vessel was similar between treatments when
		  waste was discharged, but the abundance was reduced by half
		  in absence of discharge. As a consequence, across all the
		  observation periods the seabird abundance was lowest when
		  waste was discharged every two hours, slightly higher when
		  the discharge interval was 30 minutes, and highest when the
		  waste was continuously discharged. Observations of the
		  2-hour batch discharge treatment did not cover the whole
		  period between discharge events, and so a larger difference
		  between the 2 hour and other treatments may be expected.
		  During the 2-hour treatment, waste discharge took an
		  average of around 9 minutes, whereas during the 30-minute
		  treatment waste discharge took an average of 3 minutes. The
		  rapid response of seabird numbers and behaviour to the
		  individual discharge events could not be determined, as
		  observations were made 5 minutes apart. A fixed video
		  camera was used to continuously record a view looking back
		  from the stern of the vessel. This footage has not yet been
		  analysed.
		  
		  Both large and small seabirds responded similarly to the
		  discharge treatments, and there was no apparent
		  relationship between seabird abundance and other variables,
		  such as vessel speed, swell height, or wind strength. The
		  experiment was successfully conducted, with the protocol
		  being closely followed. The preliminary descriptive
		  analysis suggests that batching fishing waste may represent
		  an efficient strategy in reducing the number of seabirds
		  that are attracted to trawlers. Statistical modelling of
		  the data would help determine the significance of this key
		  result.",

  abstract	= {This report presents a risk assessment of the effect of
		  fishing-related mortalities on 70 of the seabird species
		  that breed in the New Zealand region. The assessment covers
		  all fishing by commercial trawl, bottom-longline,
		  surface-longline, and set-net fisheries within New
		  Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone. The risk was defined as
		  the ratio of the estimated annual number of fatalities of
		  birds due to bycatch in fisheries to the Potential
		  Biological Removal (PBR), which is an estimate of the
		  number of seabirds that may be killed without causing the
		  population to decline below half the carrying capacity. The
		  risk ratio for each seabird species is an estimate of the
		  ratio between the number of fatalities due to fisheries
		  bycatch, and the PBR.
		  
		  When estimating the PBR for each species, a recovery
		  factor, f , should be specified. This recovery factor is
		  typically between 0.1 and 0.5. It allows some protection
		  against errors in estimating the PBR, and a lower value
		  allows for a shorter recovery time for depleted
		  populations. In this report, the risk ratio is calculated
		  using PBR1: the value of the PBR calculated with f = 1. The
		  values of the recovery factor for each species will be
		  specified at a later stage. When interpreting the risk
		  ratio, it should be borne in mind that species with risk
		  ratios less than one may still be considered at risk,
		  depending on the value of the recovery factor.
		  
		  Estimation of annual fatalities was based on seabird
		  captures reported by observers between the 2006--07 and
		  2010--11 fishing years. From these captures, the total
		  observable captures were estimated (the number of seabird
		  captures that would have been reported had an observer been
		  on every fishing vessel). Not all seabirds that are killed
		  are brought on-board vessels, and the observable captures
		  were multiplied by a factor to account for these cryptic
		  mortalities. The cryptic multiplier varied between 1.30 and
		  8.66, depending on fishing method and seabird species.
		  
		  This study replaces a previous seabird risk assessment that
		  used a similar methodology. Demographic parameters and
		  distributions were updated for some species, the methods
		  used for estimating observable captures were changed, and
		  calculation of the PBR was modified to include an
		  additional calibration factor. Because of the number of
		  methodological changes that were made, changes in risk
		  between the two assessments should not be taken as being
		  due to changes in the fisheries.
		  
		  In total, there were 15 100 (95% c.i.: 13 600 -- 16 600)
		  estimated annual potential seabird fatalities across the
		  four fishing methods. The highest number of annual
		  potential fatalities were in trawl fisheries with 9870 (95%
		  c.i.: 8560 -- 11 300) estimated annual potential
		  fatalities. There were a total of 3560 (95% c.i.: 3040 --
		  4150) annual potential fatalities in bottom-longline
		  fisheries. Captures in surface- longline fisheries were
		  lower, with a total of 1340 (95% c.i.: 1170 -- 1570) annual
		  potential fatalities of all seabirds. The estimated
		  fatalities in set-net fisheries were relatively low, with a
		  total of 317 (95% c.i.: 228 -- 460) annual potential
		  fatalities of all species. The estimates of these annual
		  potential fatalities depend strongly on the assumptions
		  that were made about the extent of the cryptic mortalities.
		  
		  Six species had a median risk ratio above 1 or an upper 95%
		  confidence limit above 2 and may be considered as at "Very
		  high risk": black petrel, Salvin's albatross, flesh-footed
		  shearwater, southern Buller's albatross, Chatham Island
		  albatross, and New Zealand white-capped albatross. The risk
		  ratio of black petrel was especially large, with a median
		  of 19.9 (95% c.i.: 11.4 -- 32.8), due to the combination of
		  a high number of estimated annual potential fatalities
		  (mean 1440; 95% c.i.: 1070 -- 1900), and a low PBR1 (mean
		  74; 95% c.i.: 47 -- 117). Fatalities of the species with
		  high risk ratios were mainly in poorly observed
		  small-vessel fisheries.
		  
		  Four species had a median risk ratio above 0.3 or an upper
		  95% confidence limit above 1, and may be considered as at
		  "High risk": northern Buller's albatross, Gibson's
		  albatross, Cape petrel, and Antipodean albatross. Nine
		  species had a median risk ratio above 0.1 or an upper 95%
		  confidence limit above 0.3 ("Medium risk"), and another
		  seven had an upper 95% confidence limit above 0.1 ("Low
		  risk"). Among the 70 considered species, 45 had the upper
		  95% confidence limit of their risk ratio below 0.1,
		  suggesting that commercial fisheries in New Zealand waters
		  are unlikely to significantly impact the demography of
		  these species.
		  
		  The risk assessment methodology is not yet mature, and
		  further improvements may be made in the future. Possible
		  improvements include a better specification of the cryptic
		  mortality. This improvement would require collection of
		  data on cryptic mortality in New Zealand fisheries. While
		  these kinds of data are difficult to collect, poor
		  knowledge of cryptic mortality restricts understanding of
		  the impacts of fisheries on seabird populations. For some
		  species, the assessment could be extended to include
		  fatalities in global fisheries, and to include broader
		  impacts, such as bycatch in recreational fisheries. The
		  risk assessment requires adequate observer data, and in
		  small-vessel fisheries observer coverage remains low.
		  Increasing observer coverage in these fisheries would
		  greatly reduce the uncertainty associated with the current
		  estimates of risk.

		  a total of 107 dolphin captures were reported by Ministry
		  of Fisheries observers in trawl and longline fisheries
		  within New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone. These
		  captures included 80 common dolphins, 9 pilot whales, and 7
		  dusky dolphins that were reported killed in trawl
		  fisheries. In longline fisheries over the same period,
		  eight dolphins were captured and released alive, with one
		  common dolphin and two pilot whales reported killed. There
		  have been few observations in inshore trawl fisheries, and
		  no data were available from setnet fisheries. Hector's
		  dolphin captures have previously been reported from both
		  setnet and inshore trawl fisheries, but the observer
		  database does not contain enough information to estimate
		  the captures of either Hector's or Maui's dolphins.
		  
		  The jack mackerel trawl fishery, operating off the west
		  coast of the North Island, was responsible for 91% of
		  observed dolphin mortalities in trawl fisheries. Most of
		  these mortalities were of common dolphins. Only 15 vessels
		  participated in this fishery, with over 95% of the effort
		  being carried out by just 7 vessels. A Bayesian model was
		  developed to estimate dolphin captures in the jack mackerel
		  fishery. This was the only fishery with sufficient observed
		  captures to allow a reliable estimate of total captures to
		  be made. There were 0.8 capture events per 100 observed
		  tows in the 2006--07 fishing year. Dolphins are often
		  caught in groups; the mean number killed in a single
		  capture event was 2.5 dolphins. The model had two stages:
		  first the probability that a dolphin capture event occurred
		  on a tow was predicted, then if a capture event occurred,
		  the number of dolphins killed was estimated. The model was
		  fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.
		  
		  Four covariates explained variation in the probability of a
		  capture event occurring during a trawl: headline depth, the
		  depth of the top of the trawl net; trawl duration, time
		  spent trawling, from shooting the net to hauling; light
		  condition at haul time, which depended on the time of day
		  and the illumination of the moon; and whether the tow was
		  north or south of Mount Taranaki. Headline depth had the
		  most explanatory power, with more dolphins being caught
		  when the headline depth was shallower. The model estimated
		  that deepening the headline depth of a tow by 21 metres
		  would have halved the probability of a dolphin capture
		  event.
		  
		  Annual trawl effort in the jack mackerel fishery has
		  increased dramatically since the late nineties, from 405
		  tows by three vessels in the 1995--96 fishing year, to 2164
		  tows by eight vessels in the 2006--07 fishing year.
		  Observed dolphin captures have also increased over the
		  period, with 11 dolphins caught during observed tows in
		  this fishery in 2006--07.
		  
		  The model estimated that there were fewer than 5 dolphin
		  captures a year between 1995--96 and 1998--99. As effort in
		  the fishery increased there was initially a large increase
		  in the estimated number of dolphin mortalities, which
		  peaked at 174 (95% c.i.: 74 to 366) dolphins in 2002--03.
		  Since then the number of dolphins caught each year has
		  decreased. In 2006--07 the model estimated that 52 dolphins
		  were killed in the large vessel jack mackerel fishery (95%
		  c.i.: 22 to 106). This decrease has occurred despite the
		  number of tows in the fishery remaining steady since
		  2002--03, at over 2000 tows per year.
		  
		  The abundance of common dolphin on the west coast of the
		  North Island is unknown, and so there is no basis for
		  estimating the impact of the fisheries mortalities on the
		  local population.",

		  fisheries. Between the 1995--96 and 2008--09 fishing years,
		  there were 108 common dolphin captures reported by Ministry
		  of Fisheries observers in the mackerel trawl fishery on the
		  west coast of the North Island. All captures were by
		  vessels over 90 m length. The pattern of captures was
		  similar across fishing years, with a general increase in
		  fishing effort and a concomitant increase in common dolphin
		  captures over the 14-year period. In the most recent
		  fishing year, 2008--09, fishing effort was comparatively
		  lower than in preceding years, and 11 common dolphins were
		  caught in 4 of 510 tows. Capture events frequently involved
		  the capture of more than one individual, with a maximum of
		  9 common dolphins observed caught in a single tow.
		  
		  Based on observer data, a statistical model was built that
		  estimated the total number of common dolphin captures in
		  the large vessel mackerel fishery. A two-stage Bayesian
		  hurdle model was used, with a logistic generalised linear
		  model predicting whether any common dolphin captures
		  occurred on a given tow, and a zero-truncated Poisson
		  distribution to estimate the number of dolphin captures,
		  given that there was a capture event. The model was also
		  used to explore which covariates were related to common
		  dolphin captures.
		  
		  There was little effort in the large vessel mackerel
		  fishery before 2001--02, with fewer than 1000 tows per
		  year. The estimated number of common dolphin captures was
		  also relatively small, with a median of less than 12
		  captures annually. As the effort in this fishery expanded
		  to over 2000 tows by 2002--03, there was an initial
		  increase in the estimated number of common dolphins caught
		  per year to 182 (95% c.i.: 72 to 389). Since then, the
		  number of captures has decreased, although fishing effort
		  has remained relatively high. In 2008--09, there were an
		  estimated 25 (95% c.i.: 13 to 52) common dolphins killed in
		  the large vessel mackerel fishery. The reasons for the
		  decrease in common dolphin captures since 2002--03 are
		  unknown. Lack of dolphin abundance data prevents assessment
		  of the impact of these mortalities on the common dolphin
		  population in the mackerel fishing area.
		  
		  The model found that headline depth (distance of the
		  headline below the surface) was the covariate that best
		  explained the occurrence of common dolphin captures. Both
		  the model and observer data suggest that restricting trawls
		  with shallow headlines would reduce dolphin bycatch. Of the
		  observed capture events, 50% were during the 10% of
		  observed trawls where headline depth was less than 30 m
		  below the surface. All capture events in 2008--09 occurred
		  on trawls with a headline depth of 20 m or less. Increasing
		  the headline depth by about 13 m would halve the
		  probability of a dolphin capture event on a tow. Light
		  condition, trawl duration, and sub-area were all also
		  identified as covariates associated with dolphin bycatch.
		  The model estimated that there was a higher bycatch on
		  trawls hauled between midnight and dawn, on longer trawls,
		  and on trawls in the northern sub-area of the fishing
		  region (above 30&#9702; 18 S).
		  
		  In addition to the large vessel mackerel fishery, there
		  have been observed common dolphins captured in inshore
		  trawl fisheries. Although there are large fisheries
		  targeting inshore fisheries (e.g., 78% of all trawls on the
		  west coast of the North Island in the 2008--09 fishing
		  year), observer coverage has been limited to 0--0.5% per
		  fishing year. Because of the low observer coverage, it is
		  not possible to estimate the number of common dolphins
		  caught in inshore fisheries.",

		  North Island. Most captures have been observed in the hoki
		  fishery, with 57 fur seals being observed caught in
		  2007--08. In contrast, few captures were reported from
		  deepwater or scampi fisheries.
		  
		  A Bayesian generalised linear model was developed using the
		  observed trawl effort. The model was fitted to data from
		  six fishing years, 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2008. The
		  model was then used to estimate fur seal captures on
		  unobserved tows. Trawl effort from the north and east of
		  the North Island, and from the eastern end of the Chatham
		  Rise, was excluded because there were no observed fur seal
		  captures in those areas. Trawl effort from tows targeting
		  inshore species was also excluded as observer coverage in
		  inshore fisheries was very low, and no fur seals were
		  observed caught. The model included covariates for fishing
		  area, target species, day of the year, and distance to the
		  shore. These covariates, which have been identified in
		  previous work, were selected because they explained much of
		  the variation in the capture rate.
		  
		  In 2007--08, an estimated 714 (95% c.i.: 465 to 1130) fur
		  seals were caught in trawl fisheries (with trawl fishing
		  targeting inshore species not being included). The
		  estimated capture rate was 1.55 (95% c.i.: 0.99 to 2.50)
		  fur seals per 100 tows. The estimated capture rate for
		  2007--08 was contained within the confidence intervals of
		  estimated rates for each of the six years, and there was no
		  evidence of a trend in the fur seal capture rate. In
		  2006--07, 488 (95% c.i.: 288 to 826) fur seals were
		  estimated to have been caught, and the capture rate was
		  0.98 (95% c.i.: 0.59 to 1.63) fur seals per 100 tows.
		  
		  Fur seal captures followed a strong seasonal pattern, which
		  was seen in all areas and targets. The estimated capture
		  rate peaked to about five times the mean annual rate in the
		  winter months of July, August, and September, and dropped
		  to around one fifth the mean annual rate in the summer
		  months of December, January, and February. The reduced
		  capture rates in the summer coincided with the fur seal
		  breeding season. Previous work identified the light
		  condition as important, with more fur seals caught in the
		  dark. It was found, however, that once a day of year effect
		  was included, there was little evidence of a light
		  condition effect. Distance to shore was also related to the
		  fur seal capture rate. The capture rate was reduced when
		  the fishing was more than 90 km from shore. ",

		  (Delphinus delphis), New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus

		  These incidental captures are recorded by fisheries
		  observers when they are on- board vessels. For fisheries
		  with sufficient observer coverage, these data, combined

		  statistical models. Here, we present estimates of the
		  capture of common dolphin, New Zealand fur seal and New
		  Zealand sea lion in New Zealand trawl fisheries, including
		  the 2010--11 fishing year.
		  
		  Common dolphin are frequently captured in the mackerel
		  trawl fishery on the North Island west coast. In 2010--11,
		  seven common dolphin were observed caught in six separate
		  capture events in this fishery. Over the 16-year reporting
		  period between 1995--96 and 2010--11, a total of 119 common
		  dolphin were observed captured. A two-stage Bayesian hurdle
		  model was built to estimate the total number of common
		  dolphin captures and to identify covariates that were
		  related to captures. The estimated total number of common
		  dolphin captures in the most recent fishing year was 64
		  (95% c.i.: 26 to 116), more than twice the estimate of the
		  previous year, 30 (95% c.i.: 7 to 68). The high capture
		  estimate resulted from the influence of the observed event
		  rate, which increased in the 2010--11 fishing year.
		  Headline depth (distance of the headline below the surface)
		  was confirmed as the covariate that best explained common
		  dolphin captures, and this finding was supported by
		  observer data, with the majority of observed captures
		  occurring on tows with headline depths less than 40 m. The
		  model results suggest that increasing headline depth by 21
		  m would halve the capture event probability.
		  
		  Fur seal are captured in trawl fisheries encompassing a
		  range of fishing areas and target species. In 2010--11,
		  inshore fisheries were included in the fur seal bycatch
		  assessment for the first time, following a recent increase
		  in observer effort. In this fishing year, there were a
		  total of 69 fur seal captures observed in trawl fisheries
		  in New Zealand waters. In the 9-year period between
		  2002--03 and 2010--11, a total of 922 fur seal were
		  recorded as bycatch by fisheries observers. The highest
		  observed capture rate in 2010--11 was in southern blue
		  whiting fisheries (8.33 fur seal captures per 100 tows),
		  followed by ling fisheries (1.96 observed fur seal captures
		  per 100 tows). The total number of estimated captures
		  derived from Bayesian models was 376 (95% c.i.: 221 to 668)
		  in the 2010--11 fishing year. This estimate is a decrease
		  from the total 472 (95% c.i.: 269 to 914) estimated
		  captures in 2009--10. The two covariates distance from
		  shore and day of year were correlated with fur seal
		  captures. The fur seal capture rate decreased with
		  increasing distance from shore. At the same time, there was
		  strong seasonal variation in fur seal captures, with a peak
		  in August, and relatively high captures in July and
		  September.
		  
		  New Zealand sea lion have historically been frequently
		  caught in the squid trawl fishery around Auckland Islands,
		  and most observed sea lion captures between 1995--96 and
		  2010--11 have been in this fishery; however, in 2010--11,
		  there were no observed captures in this fishery. In
		  contrast, six male sea lion were observed captured in the
		  Campbell Island southern blue whiting fishery, with one
		  released alive and two caught in one net. Capture estimates
		  for this fishing year revealed a total of 29 (95% c.i.: 17
		  to 43) sea lion captures in all trawl fisheries. This
		  estimate is a decrease from 46 (95% c.i.: 32 to 66)
		  captures in 2009--10.
		  
		  Owing to the high number of incidental sea lion captures in
		  the Auckland Islands squid fishery, this fishery uses sea
		  lion exclusion devices (SLEDs) that are fitted to the trawl
		  nets to allow sea lion to escape the net. On tows using
		  SLEDs, the number and fate of sea lion that may have
		  escaped the net are unknown. To account for this
		  uncertainty, the Auckland Islands squid fishery model
		  includes an estimate of the retention probability of sea
		  lion on tows with SLEDs. The retention probability is then
		  used to estimate the number of interactions, that is, the
		  number of sea lion that would have been caught had no SLEDs
		  been used. As the SLED design changed during the reporting
		  period, estimates of the retention probability were derived
		  by combining two models that included either a single or a
		  split SLED retention probability.
		  
		  The resulting number of estimated interactions in 2010--11
		  was 56 (95% c.i.: 4 to 233), with a corresponding strike
		  rate of 3.5 (95% c.i.: 0.4 to 14.9) sea lion interactions
		  per 100 tows. Both estimates were lower than those in
		  2009--10, but the large variation around the mean values
		  highlights the uncertainty associated with these estimates.
		  In addition to the dataset becoming more biased toward tows
		  that used SLEDs, the decrease in observed captures in
		  recent years makes it increasingly difficult to estimate
		  the number of interactions and strike rate in the Auckland
		  Islands squid fishery. "

		  fisheries are estimated for the 1995--96 to 2006--07
		  fishing years. Over this period, Ministry of Fisheries
		  observers recorded the capture of between 5 and 39 sea
		  lions within the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone,
		  within each fishing year. During the 2006--07 fishing year,
		  15 sea lions were observed killed on trawls. For the
		  purposes of this report, three captures were included in
		  this total that were observed on the first day of the
		  2007--08 fishing year, in the last days of the southern
		  blue whiting fishery. All of the captured sea lions were
		  retrieved dead. Of the 15 sea lion captures, 7 were
		  observed caught in the squid fishery around the Auckland
		  Islands. This was the lowest number of observed captures in
		  this fishery since the 1998--99 fishing year. Six sea lion
		  captures were observed in the southern blue whiting fishery
		  east of Campbell Island, continuing a trend of increasing
		  captures in that fishery since 2002. Two other captures
		  occurred, one in the scampi fishery near the Auckland
		  Islands, and one in the squid fishery south of The Snares.
		  
		  From these observations, estimates of total captures were
		  made for four different trawl fisheries: the squid fishery
		  near the Auckland Islands; the southern blue whiting
		  fishery east of Campbell Island; other (non-squid)
		  fisheries near the Auckland Islands; and all trawl
		  fisheries on the southern end of the Stewart- Snares shelf.
		  Bayesian generalised linear models were fitted to data from
		  the first two of these fisheries. A previous model, used
		  for estimating sea lion captures in the 2004--05 fishing
		  year, was re-implemented for the Auckland Islands squid
		  fishery. A new model was developed for the southern blue
		  whiting fishery. Ratio estimates were calculated for the
		  other (non-squid) Auckland Islands trawl fishery, and for
		  all trawl fisheries on the southern end of the
		  Stewart-Snares shelf.
		  
		  Over the 12 years of data, fishing effort in the squid
		  fishery near the Auckland Islands was highest in the
		  1995--96 fishing year, with 4467 trawls being made. Effort
		  then decreased to fewer than 2000 trawls in each year
		  between 1997--98 and 2002--03. In each year between
		  2003--04 and 2005--06, over 2400 trawls were made. The
		  trawl effort fell to 1320 trawls in 2006--07.
		  
		  Since 2001, squid trawl nets in the Auckland Islands squid
		  fishery have increasingly been fitted with sea lion
		  exclusion devices (SLEDs) that allow animals to escape from
		  the net. The estimated interactions (captures and escapes
		  via SLEDs) follow the patterns in effort. In 1995--96 and
		  1996--97 there were an estimated 141 and 140 interactions,
		  respectively. In each year between 1997--98 and 2002--03
		  there were fewer than 75 estimated interactions. For the
		  three years 2003--04 to 2005--06 there were 140 or more
		  interactions. In 2006--07, the model estimated that there
		  were 74 (95% c.i.: 32 to 136) sea lion interactions.
		  
		  The model estimated that the probability that a sea lion
		  failed to escape from a net fitted with a SLED (i.e., the
		  retention probability) was 0.24 (95% c.i,: 0.13 to 0.39).
		  This was similar to previous estimates, and correspondingly
		  the predicted strike rate in 2006--07 of 5.6 sea lions per
		  100 trawls (95% c.i.: 2.7 to 10) was similar to estimates
		  of the strike rate made previously. As SLEDs have been used
		  more widely, the number of captures has fallen relative to
		  the number of interactions, and in 2006--07 there were an
		  estimated 20 (95% c.i.: 11 to 33) sea lion captures in the
		  Auckland Islands squid fishery. The number of attributed
		  mortalities in this fishery in 2006--07 was 60 (95% c.i.:
		  26 to 110), assuming a discount rate of 20%, which is less
		  than the limit of 93 mortalities set by the Ministry of
		  Fisheries.
		  
		  There were 518 trawls made east of Campbell Island in the
		  2007 southern blue whiting season, of which 33% were
		  observed. The observed sea lion capture rate was 3.49
		  animals per 100 trawls, and has increased over the last
		  four years, from an observed captures rate of 0.37 animals
		  per 100 trawls in 2002. Our model estimated 14 captures for
		  2007 (95% c.i.: 7 to 27), an estimated strike rate of 2.39
		  captures per hundred trawls (95% c.i.: 1.5 to 24.6).
		  
		  In 2006--07, the bootstrapped ratio method provided
		  estimates of 12 captures (95% c.i.: 1 to 27) in other
		  (non-squid) Auckland Islands trawl fisheries, and 5
		  captures (95% c.i.: 2 to 9) for all trawl fisheries on the
		  southern Stewart-Snares shelf. Estimates were also made for
		  the 2004--05 and 2005--06 fishing years, because of the
		  small number of captures no clear trends were discernible.
		  
		  The four estimates were combined for the three fishing
		  years 2004--05 to 2006--07. The total estimates for
		  2006--07 were 51 sea lion captures (95% c.i.: 33 to 74),
		  and 105 sea lion interactions (95% c.i.: 60 to 169). This
		  compared with a total estimate for 2005--06 of 60 captures
		  (95% c.i.: 39 to 87) and 170 interactions (95% c.i.: 92 to
		  286). The reduction between the two years was largely due
		  to a decrease in effort in the Auckland Islands squid
		  fishery.",

		  were retrieved dead, and 1 was released alive. Of the 8 sea

		  around the Auckland Islands. This was the lowest number of
		  observed captures in this fishery since the 1998--99
		  fishing year. Two sea lion captures were observed in the

		  From these observations, estimates of total captures were

		  Since 2001, trawl nets in the Auckland Islands squid
		  fishery have increasingly been fitted with sea lion
		  exclusion devices (SLEDs) that allow animals to escape from
		  the net. The model estimated that the probability a sea

		  the retention probability) was 0.234 (95% c.i,: 0.14 to
		  0.38). This was similar to previous estimates, and

		  5.2 sea lions per 100 trawls (95% c.i.: 2.2 to 9.7) was
		  similar to estimates of the strike rate made previously. As
		  SLEDs have been used more widely, the number of captures
		  has fallen relative to the number of interactions, and in
		  2007--08 there were an estimated 14 (95% c.i.: 7 to 25) sea
		  lion captures in the Auckland Islands squid fishery. For
		  the same year, the model estimated that there were 65 (95%
		  c.i.: 26 to 124) sea lion interactions, the lowest number
		  of estimated interactions since 2002--03. This decrease was
		  largely due to a decrease in effort from a peak of 2706

		  There were 552 trawls made in the Campbell Island southern

		  capture of three New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri)
		  during the 2008--09 fishing year. This was the lowest
		  number of observed captures in the period covered by the
		  data. The captures were reported from fisheries around the
		  Auckland Islands: two sea lions were caught by trawlers
		  targeting squid, and one sea lion was caught on a tow
		  targeting scampi. Five sea lion captures were reported by
		  fishers, from vessels targeting squid near the Auckland
		  Islands. Two of these animals were among those reported by
		  the observers, resulting in a total of six reported sea
		  lion captures during the 2008--09 fishing year.
		  
		  From the observed captures, estimates of total captures
		  were made for four different strata: trawl effort targeting
		  squid near the Auckland Islands, other trawl effort near
		  the Auckland Islands, trawl effort targeting southern blue
		  whiting near Campbell Island, and all trawl effort on the
		  southern end of the Stewart-Snares shelf. Estimates of sea

		  a single total estimate was calculated by combining the
		  output from all strata. The statistical methods used to
		  make the estimates followed those used for estimating
		  captures in 2006--07 and 2007--08.
		  
		  There were 1925 tows targeting squid in the Auckland Island
		  fishery in 2008--09, a 52% increase from the 2007--08
		  fishing year. In 2008--09, it was estimated that 9 (95%
		  c.i.: 3 to 21) sea lions were captured in this fishery.
		  This was the lowest number of estimated captures in the
		  period covered by the data. Trawlers fishing for squid near
		  the Auckland Islands (within the SQU 6T area) use Sea Lion
		  Exclusion Devices (SLEDs) to reduce the number of captures.
		  These consist of a grid fitted before the codend of the
		  net, with an open hole above the grid that sea lions can
		  pass through. The model also estimated the number of
		  interactions, the number of sea lions that would have been
		  caught if no SLEDs were used. In 2008--09, the number of
		  interactions in the Auckland Islands squid fishery was
		  estimated at 56 (95% c.i.: 16 to 131), with a corresponding
		  strike rate of 3.0 (95% c.i.: 0.9 to 6.4) interactions per
		  100 tows. This was one of the lowest strike rates within
		  the period of the data, but was not significantly different
		  from the strike rate of 5.65 interactions per 100 tows
		  assumed by the Ministry of Fisheries in setting management
		  objectives for the squid fishery.
		  
		  There was a small increase in trawl effort targeting
		  southern blue whiting near Campbell Island, 609 tows in
		  2008--09 compared with 552 in 2007--08. Estimated captures
		  in this fishery peaked at 16 (95% c.i.: 8 to 28) in the
		  2007 calendar year, but fell to 1 (95% c.i.: 0 to 5) in
		  2009.
		  
		  Observed sea lion captures in other fisheries have been
		  sporadic, and captures in these fisheries were estimated
		  using ratio methods that assumed a constant strike rate
		  over the period of the data. This resulted in estimates for
		  2008--09 of 13 (95% c.i.: 7 to 19) captures in non-squid
		  fisheries near the Auckland Islands, and 3 (95% c.i.: 1 to
		  4) captures in squid fisheries on the southern
		  Stewart-Snares shelf.
		  
		  Taken together, the total estimated captures for 2008--09
		  were 25 (95% c.i: 16 to 39). This was the lowest number of
		  estimated captures in the 14 year period covered by the

		  bottom longline and set-net, were not available for the
		  period covered.
		  
		  Ministry of Fisheries observers report captures of
		  protected species when they occur, and these data are
		  presented here. Observers in trawl fisheries recorded 177
		  bird captures in the first half of 2007-- 08, an increase
		  from 124 bird captures in the first half of 2006--07. The
		  most frequently caught birds in trawl fisheries were 65
		  sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus), 45 white-chinned

		  albatross (Thalassarche steadi). Other captures included

		  captures of Campbell albatross (Thalassarche impavida) and
		  southern royal albatross (Diomedea epomophora). One black
		  petrel (Procellaria parkinsoni) was caught in a scampi
		  trawl, and was confirmed by necropsy. A Westland petrel
		  (Procellaria westlandica) was reported caught alive by an
		  observer, but the identity could not be confirmed as it was
		  released.
		  
		  There were 25 New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus
		  forsteri) observed caught in trawl fisheries, 21 of them
		  south of 48&#9702; south. Seven New Zealand sea lions
		  (Phocarctos hookeri) were caught, four of them in the
		  Auckland Islands squid fishery and three in the southern
		  blue whiting fishery to the east of Campbell Island. There
		  were 20 dolphins, identified by the observers as common
		  dolphin (Delphinus delphis), caught in the jack mackerel
		  fishery on the west coast of the North Island. This was
		  twice as many as were observed caught in the first half of
		  2006--07. No other species of marine mammal were observed
		  caught, and there were no marine mammals caught in surface
		  longline fisheries. No turtles were caught in either trawl
		  or surface longline fisheries.
		  
		  Between the first half of 2006--07 and the first half of
		  2007--08 the total trawl effort decreased from 54 500 to 48
		  300 tows. In contrast, the number of observed tows
		  increased from 3884 to 4436. Most bird captures were in the
		  squid trawl fishery. There was a small increase in the
		  number of observed tows in the squid fishery, from 1075 to
		  1194. Observed captures rose from 89 to 136 birds, and the
		  capture rate increased from 8.3 to 11.4 birds per one
		  hundred tows. However, across all trawl fisheries, observed
		  captures of white-capped albatross decreased from 42 to 30
		  birds. Observed captures of other albatross species
		  increased slightly from 12 to 14 birds. Of the 30
		  white-capped albatross caught in the first half of
		  2007--08, only eight were caught on trawl warps. Coverage
		  of inshore trawl fisheries remains low. During the first
		  half of the 2007--08 fishing year 97 inshore trawls were
		  observed, 0.3% of the fishery. During these trawls two
		  birds were caught, a cape petrel (Daption capense) and a
		  white-capped albatross.
		  
		  There were seven birds observed caught in surface longline
		  fisheries, compared with 85 in the first half of 2006--07.
		  All birds were caught by domestic vessels. The species
		  caught were two flesh-footed shearwaters, two Buller's
		  albatross, one Salvin's albatross, one Gibson's albatross
		  (Diomedea gibsoni) and one unidentified petrel. The large
		  decrease in the total observed captures can be attributed
		  to the absence of charter surface longline vessels fishing
		  operating in the first half of 2007&#8212;08. Although
		  observer coverage in the domestic longline fishery was low
		  (only 3.4% of hooks were observed), there was a decrease in

		  region is characterized by weak currents, high nutrients,
		  low chlorophyll, moderate summer mixed layer depth, and is
		  remote from the influence of sea-ice and coastal waters. In
		  other words, the SOIREE site is typical of a broad area of
		  the open ocean waters of the Southern Ocean. SOIREE was
		  carried out in late summer (February), close to the time of
		  maximum seasonal nutrient depletion and well past the usual
		  seasonal peak in production and export. While the seasonal
		  nutrient draw-down is substantial, levels of all three

		  growth. In contrast, north of the southern branch of the

		  physiological changes, adding iron is likely to have little
		  effect on carbon export by the silica pump, which plays the
		  dominant role in carbon export in both the modern and
		  glacial Southern Ocean. As a consequence, it may not be as
		  easy to draw down all the macro-nutrients in the Southern
		  Ocean as previously assumed in assessing the response of
		  the global carbon cycle to iron fertilization. The iron
		  hypothesis for glacial-interglacial changes in carbon
		  dioxide requires that the silica limitation be alleviated
		  in waters north of the present-day Polar Front (by changes
		  in ocean circulation), as well as an increase in aeolian

		  dynamical features of the flow. The small scale variations
		  are related to the characteristics of coherent vortex
		  structures, and there are low FTLEs inside vortices and
		  filaments of high FTLEs in strain-dominated regions
		  surrounding these vortices. Regional variations in the
		  stirring are closely related to variations in mesoscale
		  activity and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). High values of mean
		  FTLE occur in regions of high EKE (highest mean values of
		  around 0.2 day$^{-1}$ occur in the EAC separation region)
		  whereas small values occur in regions with low EKE (mean
		  values around 0.03 day$^{-1}$ in the east Tasman sea). There is
		  a compact relationship between the mean FTLEs and EKE,
		  raising the possibility of using the easily-calculated EKE
		  to estimate the stirring. This possibility is even more
		  intriguing as the FTLE distributions can be approximated,
		  for the time scales considered here, by Weibull
		  distributions with shape parameter equal to 1.6, which can
		  be defined from the mean value alone.",

  abstract	= "We examined the risk of fisheries incidental mortality
		  causing population declines for a suite of seabird species
		  in 14 New Zealand fisheries using trawl and longline
		  methods. We applied a method developed by Sharp et al.
		  (2009) that used the available data on species biology,
		  fisheries interactions, and fishing effort in a
		  semi-quantitative Ecological Risk Assessment framework.
		  Data quality was a strong pre-occupation in the study, with
		  species abundance and productivity data being of extremely
		  variable quality. Fishery data on captures were relatively
		  sparse for small longline fisheries. Therefore, the results
		  should be interpreted with caution, and are best used to
		  guide the setting of research and management priorities.
		  Sixty-three species were studied, but the final analysis
		  reports on data for 39, the remainder being excluded due to
		  lack of data in the relevant fisheries at this time.
		  
		  The primary statistic generated by the study is the risk
		  score, which describes the risk of adverse effects at
		  species level from fishing mortalities -- it is the number
		  of likely captures in New Zealand commercial fisheries,
		  over the species-specific index of population productivity.
		  Our primary findings in relation to the likely impacts of
		  fishing mortality on species, by fishery and area were:
		  
		  1. Nineteen of 39 species (19 species, 90%Confidence Limit
		  (CL)) had risk scores of 0.01 or above, which we define as
		  having more-than-negligible levels of fisheries
		  interaction. 20 species had negligible levels of
		  interactions.
		  
		  2. For 4 species (7 species, 90%CL) there could be cause
		  for concern as the likely captures exceed the Potential
		  Biological Removals (PBR) index (very high risk) and one
		  other species (4 species, 90% CL) showed high risk. The
		  species of greatest concern, in descending order were:
		  Westland petrel, Chatham albatross, black-browed albatross,
		  northern royal albatross, and southern Buller's albatross.
		  
		  3. The following species had risk scores of moderate risk
		  for the median value of the risk score, but these changed
		  to high or very high risk with the 90% CL. This indicates
		  considerable uncertainty around the risk scores, and which
		  warrants further research: Kermadec white-faced storm
		  petrel, southern royal albatross, Antipodean albatross
		  (both populations), Salvin's albatross, Campbell albatross,
		  and black petrel.
		  
		  4. The suite of species identified in points 2 and 3 above
		  are a high priority for research that helps define input
		  parameters to the analysis. In some cases, this may be a
		  greater knowledge of the species-specific catch rates, and
		  for others, of basic biological attributes such as
		  abundance and population growth rate. For some of these
		  species, research is underway that will lead to better
		  definition of biological parameters.
		  
		  5. Warp strike affecting small albatrosses in trawl
		  fisheries can result in birds being killed but not brought
		  on board the vessel. These cryptic kills are not recorded
		  by fisheries observers. When cryptic kills from trawl warp
		  strike were included, at rates of 2 times (and 10 times)
		  the likely capture values, the following seven species
		  achieved very high risk rankings: Chatham albatross,
		  black-browed albatrosses, southern Buller's albatross,
		  Salvin's albatross, Campbell albatross, northern Buller's
		  albatross, and white-capped albatross. There is
		  considerable uncertainty around the effect that
		  warp-strikes may have on the risk levels for these birds,
		  which may increase the priority for research on cryptic
		  kills.
		  
		  6. Four fisheries were identified as having the largest
		  overall impact at species level, both in terms of captures
		  of species with high to very high risk, and the number of
		  overall captures throughout the NZEEZ. These were inshore
		  trawl, small vessel bottom longline, squid trawl, and small
		  vessel surface longline fisheries.
		  
		  7. The greatest risk overall was in Fishery Management
		  Areas (FMAs) 1 and 2, with high risk for some fisheries in
		  FMAs 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and lower risk in FMAs 8,9, and 10.
		  
		  8. Five fishing groups made little or no contribution to
		  the total seabird bycatch (<1% of the total captures each)
		  or to risk to individual species (<4% for any species
		  each). These were bottom longline autoline, middle depths
		  fresher trawl, southern blue whiting trawl, mackerel trawl,
		  and deepwater trawl fisheries.
		  
		  9. Those five species ranked with very high or high risk in
		  the study have IUCN threat rankings of Critical to
		  Vulnerable. Of the six species ranked of moderate risk, all
		  were listed by the IUCN as Vulnerable. This indicates that
		  at an international level, conservation concern for the
		  species is high. Of these 11 species, ten breed only in New
		  Zealand. Local loss of these species' populations would
		  lead to global extinction.
		  
		  10. The species identified as having high to very high risk
		  in the analysis are affected by a number of fisheries.
		  Bycatch management measures currently apply in only a
		  proportion of those fisheries. Monitoring of seabird catch
		  has previously been focused in high-value and mainly
		  southern fisheries, while the areas of greatest risk
		  identified here occur in small vessel fisheries in both
		  trawl and longline fleets, and predominantly in northern
		  areas (in particular FMAs 1 and 2).
		  
		  11. While ongoing research of this issue is recommended,
		  the current results present the culmination of research and
		  development of methods over several years in Ecological
		  Risk Assessment for seabirds in New Zealand and Pacific
		  fisheries, and make use of the available data. It needs to
		  be acknowledged that the data quality is variable across
		  species, but data were relatively robust for albatross and
		  Procellaria petrel species. These were the species
		  identified as most likely to be suffering population
		  effects from fisheries mortality in the study.
		  
		  12. The study presents the most recent in a series of
		  comprehensive assessments of seabird risk from fishing
		  mortality in New Zealand fisheries. The methods used are
		  responsive to changes in fishing practice, distribution of
		  effort, and improved knowledge of species biology. They
		  will provide a useful tool for assessing risk and targeting
		  measures to manage it in New Zealand fisheries through time.
		  
		  13. Other fisheries, such as flatfish trawl, set net, troll
		  and purse-seine could be treated with the methods explored
		  in this study as observer data become available for these
		  fisheries. Improved information about a number of species
		  included in the analyses is expected over the next 2-3
		  years, as long-term research programmes deliver their
		  findings. Therefore, we can optimistically expect improved
		  information, understanding, and finer-scale management of
		  this important environmental risk. ",
